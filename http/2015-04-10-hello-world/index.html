			<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

			<p>
				Welcome to this new blog of mine! I'm teaching myself embedded
				programming<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>, and I
				decided to write about every step I'm taking. To get started, I
				ordered an
				<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue">Arduino
				Due</a>, which arrived just this morning.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because getting started with Arduino is pretty easy and the
				process is well-documented on the
				<a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino website</a>, I don't feel
				the need to get into it too much. So, let's get right to the
				point. The first program I ran on my Due:
			</p>

			<pre>
int led = 13;

void setup() {
	pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
	digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
	delay(500);
	digitalWrite(led, LOW);
	delay(500);
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				In the world of non-embedded programming, the traditional first
				program is one that prints "Hello, World!" or something similar.
				On embedded platforms, printing is usually not that
				straight-forward, so I
				wrote<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a> something
				simpler. The program above blinks the Due's built-int LED, and
				keeps doing so until I cut the power.
			</p>

			<p>
				A humble start, but good enough for my first post. You can
				always get the latest version of my code from
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">GitHub</a>.
				Hope to see you next time!
			</p>

					Actually, I already know a bit of embedded programming. I
					had a few courses for my Bachelor degree and did some
					Arduino work for a client. Still, I feel like I don't know
					nearly enough about the topic, so that's why I'm here.

					borrowed</a>".
