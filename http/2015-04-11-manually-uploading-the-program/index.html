			<h1>Manually Uploading the Program</h1>

			<p>
				In my <a href="/2015-04-10-hello-world">last article</a>, I
				presented a program that blinks the built-in LED on my
				<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue">Arduino
				Due</a>. There's one problem though: I don't like the Arduino
				software stack.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now don't get me wrong. I think Arduino is really good at what
				it sets out to do: Making it easy for beginners to get started.
				But as a professional software developer, I felt that it was
				very limiting in some
				ways<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>. Also, the whole
				point of this project is to teach myself embedded programming.
				Using libraries and an IDE that shield me from all the nasty
				details won't do me much good.
			</p>

			<p>
				So why did I buy an Arduino board? Fair question. I felt that
				the Arduino Due is a nice piece of hardware, with its ARM
				processor and many I/O pins. There's also the whole ecosystem
				around Arduino, with extension boards for every purpose. Since
				I'm mostly interested in software and want to keep the soldering
				to a minimum (at least for now), those extension boards seem
				like very interesting options for the future.
			</p>

			<p>
				But back on topic. I'd like to get rid of the Arduino stack, and
				starting with the upload of the program to the board seems like
				a good first step<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>. The
				Arduino IDE uses
				<a href="http://www.shumatech.com/web/products/bossa">BOSSA</a>
				under the hood, so why not use it directly? As a Linux user, I
				opted to install the BOSSA command-line
				tools<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, we need to find out which file we need to upload. You can
				configure the Arduino IDE to show verbose output for the build
				process (under <code>File -> Preferences</code>). Running a
				build with verbose output gives us the name of the last file
				that is built. This might be something like
				<code>/tmp/build3099703041495893619.tmp/blink.cpp.bin</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once we know the path of the file, we can upload it to the
				Arduino using <code>bossac</code>:
			</p>

			<pre>
bossac --write --verify --boot -R &lt;insert file here&gt;
			</pre>

			<p>
				No, here's a <strong>very important caveat</strong>: For this
				command to work, the Due needs to be erased before the upload.
				The Arduino IDE seems to do that automatically, and maybe one of
				these days I too will figure out how to do it. For now, I'm
				quite happy to erase the board manually though. This can be done
				by pressing the tiny <code>ERASE</code> button on the board (not
				to be confused with the somewhat bigger <code>RESET</code>
				button).
			</p>

			<p>
				If everything went well, you should see something like this:
			</p>

			<pre>
Device found on ttyACM3
Write 11952 bytes to flash
[==============================] 100% (47/47 pages)
Verify 11952 bytes of flash
[==============================] 100% (47/47 pages)
Verify successful
Set boot flash true
CPU reset.
			</pre>

			<p>
				That's it for this installment. As always, the code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!

					As I mentioned earlier, I did an Arduino project for a
					client once. That left me with the impression that Arduino
					is very good for getting started and doing small project,
					but can be very limiting when your project grows and you
					really need to understand what's going on under the hood.
					That's just my opinion though, and I encourage you to try it
					for yourself.

					Believe me, I tried a lot of options before coming the that
					particular conclusion.

				<p>
					I'm running Ubuntu, and
					<code>sudo apt-get install bossa-cli</code> did the trick for
					me. Getting any of this to work on other systems is left as
					an exercise to the reader.
