			<h1>Building Our Program Manually</h1>

			<p>
				<a href="/2015-04-11-manually-uploading-the-program">Last
				time</a>, we stopped relying on the Arduino IDE for uploading
				the program to the board. Today, I'm going to show you how to
				build the program ourselves. To get started, we first need to
				translate our <code>blink.ino</code> file into proper C code:
			</p>

			<pre>
// blink.c

#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

int led = 13;

void setup() {
	pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
	digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
	delay(200);
	digitalWrite(led, LOW);
	delay(800);
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				As you can see, besides including the Arduino header file,
				nothing has changed<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ok then, how do we turn this C file into something we can upload
				to the Arduino Due? This question turned out to be surprisingly
				easy to answer: Just run an Arduino IDE build with verbose
				output and see what it does. As I found out, the Arduino IDE
				first builds our program into an object file. Here's how we can
				do that:
			</p>

			<pre>
ARDUINO_IDE=&lt;insert path to Arduino IDE&gt;

arm-none-eabi-g++ \
	-c \
	-nostdlib \
	-Dprintf=iprintf \
	-MMD \
	-mcpu=cortex-m3 \
	-DF_CPU=84000000L \
	-DARDUINO=10700 \
	-DARDUINO_SAM_DUE \
	-DARDUINO_ARCH_SAM \
	-D__SAM3X8E__ \
	-mthumb \
	-DUSB_VID=0x2a03 \
	-DUSB_PID=0x003e \
	-DUSBCON \
	-DUSB_MANUFACTURER="Unknown" \
	-DUSB_PRODUCT="Arduino Due" \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/system/libsam \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/system/CMSIS/CMSIS/Include/ \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/system/CMSIS/Device/ATMEL/ \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/cores/arduino \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/variants/arduino_due_x \
	blink.c \
	-o blink.o
			</pre>

			<p>
				There are several things to note about this command:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This uses the <code>arm-none-eabi-g++</code> compiler, which
					is a version of <code>g++</code> that's specific to the kind
					of ARM-based microcontrollers that the Arduino Due is an
					example of<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					I've removed a lot of optimization flags that would have
					been useful eventually, but complicated this build step. For
					now, I'm only interested in getting something simple to
					work. We can refine our approach later.
				</li>
				<li>
					The flags that are left tell the compiler to generate an
					object file (<code>blink.o</code>), without linking the C
					standard library and also give it some details about the
					target CPU and the Arduino Due. All of this is not terribly
					interesting, as I'm going to replace all this stuff with
					something else in a future article.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Now we've built our program, but that's not all. We still need
				to build the final executable that has all the Arduino libraries
				linked into it<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
ARDUINO_IDE=&lt;insert path to Arduino IDE&gt;
ARDUINO_TMP=&lt;insert path of the IDE's temporary build directory&gt;

arm-none-eabi-gcc \
	-Wl,--gc-sections \
	-mcpu=cortex-m3 \
	-T$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/variants/arduino_due_x/linker_scripts/gcc/flash.ld \
	-L$ARDUINO_TMP \
	-mthumb \
	-Wl,--entry=Reset_Handler \
	-Wl,--start-group \
		$ARDUINO_TMP/syscalls_sam3.c.o blink.o \
		$ARDUINO_TMP/variant.cpp.o \
		$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/variants/arduino_due_x/libsam_sam3x8e_gcc_rel.a \
		$ARDUINO_TMP/core.a \
	-Wl,--end-group \
	-lm \
	-o blink.elf
			</pre>

			<p>
				This second build command takes our previously built object file
				and several Arduino library files and generates an executable
				file (<code>blink.elf</code>) out of that. Again, there are
				several things to note about this command:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The various Arduino libraries we need are actually not
					distributed in compiled form with the Arduino IDE. They are
					built as part of our program's build process. This means for
					this to work, you need to run a build using the Arduino IDE
					at least once. I ran this for the program from my
					<a href="/2015-04-10-hello-world">first article</a>, but I
					suspect any other Arduino sketch will work, too.
				</li>
				<li>
					After you run that build, you need to find out the path of
					the temporary directory that the Arduino IDE saves the
					libraries we need in. You can easily do this by enabling
					verbose build output (<code>File -> Preferences</code>). On
					a Linux system, the path should look something like this:
					<code>/tmp/build7671134933141820113.tmp</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Again, the other details of that command are not that
					interesting, as it will be replaced later.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Now we have an executable for our program, but we're still not
				done! The executable we built is in the
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>
				format. This format is used on a lot of operating systems, but
				for a bare-metal ARM board, we need something different:
			</p>

			<pre>
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary blink.elf blink.bin
			</pre>

			<p>
				This final command will convert the binary into the correct
				format. We can upload this to the Due using the method from the
				<a href="/2015-04-11-manually-uploading-the-program">last
				article</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
bossac --write --verify --boot -R blink.bin
			</pre>

			<p>
				If everything worked out, the code will be uploaded to the board
				and you can watch the built-in LED blink to your heart's
				content. Don't forget that you need to erase the board before
				the upload (using the <code>ERASE</code> button).
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!

				<p>
					Actually, I did sneak another change in: The timing of the
					blinking has changed. I did this so I can tell the
					difference between <code>arduino.ino</code> and
					<code>arduino.c</code> programs, once they have been
					uploaded to the board.
				</p>

				<a name="note-2"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[2]</span>
				<p>
					As I said before, I'm using Ubuntu, so I could simply
					install this via
					<code>sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi</code>.
				</p>

				<a name="note-3"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[3]</span>
				<p>
					Even though we're in the process of removing the Arduino IDE
					from the build process, we're still using the Arduino
					libraries for our program. So for the time being, we still
					need to link them in.
