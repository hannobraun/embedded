			<h1>Building Our Program Manually</h1>

			<p>
				<a href="/2015-04-11-manually-uploading-the-program">Last
				time</a>, we stopped relying on the Arduino IDE for uploading
				the program to the board. Today, I'm going to show you how we
				can build the program ourselves. To get started, we first need
				to translate our <code>blink.ino</code> file into proper C code:
			</p>

			<pre>
// blink.c

#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

int led = 13;

void setup() {
	pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
	digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
	delay(200);
	digitalWrite(led, LOW);
	delay(800);
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				As you can see, besides including the Arduino header file,
				nothing has changed<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ok then, how do we turn this C file into something we can upload
				to the Arduino Due? This question turned out to be surprisingly
				easy to answer: Just run an Arduino IDE build with verbose
				output and see what it does. As I found out, the Arduino IDE
				first compiles the program into an object file. Here's how we can
				do that:
			</p>

			<pre>
ARDUINO_IDE=&lt;insert path to Arduino IDE&gt;

arm-none-eabi-g++ \
	-c \
	-nostdlib \
	-Dprintf=iprintf \
	-MMD \
	-mcpu=cortex-m3 \
	-DF_CPU=84000000L \
	-DARDUINO=10700 \
	-DARDUINO_SAM_DUE \
	-DARDUINO_ARCH_SAM \
	-D__SAM3X8E__ \
	-mthumb \
	-DUSB_VID=0x2a03 \
	-DUSB_PID=0x003e \
	-DUSBCON \
	-DUSB_MANUFACTURER="Unknown" \
	-DUSB_PRODUCT="Arduino Due" \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/system/libsam \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/system/CMSIS/CMSIS/Include/ \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/system/CMSIS/Device/ATMEL/ \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/cores/arduino \
	-I$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/variants/arduino_due_x \
	blink.c \
	-o blink.o
			</pre>

			<p>
				There are several things to note about this command:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This uses the <code>arm-none-eabi-g++</code> compiler, which
					is a version of <code>g++</code> that's specific to
					ARM-based
					microcontrollers<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					I've removed a lot of optimization flags that would have
					been useful eventually, but complicated this build step. For
					now, I'm only interested in getting something simple to
					work. We can refine our approach later.
				</li>
				<li>
					The flags that are left tell the compiler to generate an
					object file (<code>blink.o</code>) without linking in the
					standard library and also give it some details about the
					target CPU and the Arduino Due. All of this is not terribly
					interesting, as I'm going to replace all of this stuff with
					something else in the future.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Now we've compiled our program, but that's not all. We still
				need to build the final executable that has all the Arduino
				libraries linked into
				it<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
ARDUINO_IDE=&lt;insert path to Arduino IDE&gt;
ARDUINO_TMP=&lt;insert path of the IDE's temporary build directory&gt;

arm-none-eabi-gcc \
	-Wl,--gc-sections \
	-mcpu=cortex-m3 \
	-T$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/variants/arduino_due_x/linker_scripts/gcc/flash.ld \
	-L$ARDUINO_TMP \
	-mthumb \
	-Wl,--entry=Reset_Handler \
	-Wl,--start-group \
		$ARDUINO_TMP/syscalls_sam3.c.o blink.o \
		$ARDUINO_TMP/variant.cpp.o \
		$ARDUINO_IDE/hardware/arduino/sam/variants/arduino_due_x/libsam_sam3x8e_gcc_rel.a \
		$ARDUINO_TMP/core.a \
	-Wl,--end-group \
	-lm \
	-o blink.elf
			</pre>

			<p>
				This second build command gnerates an executable file
				(<code>blink.elf</code>) from our object file and several
				Arduino libraries. Again, there are several things to note here:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The various Arduino libraries we need are actually not
					distributed in compiled form with the Arduino IDE. They are
					built as part of our program's build process. This means,
					for this to work, you have to run a build using the Arduino
					IDE at least once. I ran a build of the program from my
					<a href="/2015-04-10-hello-world">first article</a>, but I
					suspect any Arduino sketch will do.
				</li>
				<li>
					After you run that build, you need to find out where the
					Arduino IDE saves the libraries we need. You can easily do
					this by enabling verbose build output
					(<code>File -> Preferences</code>). On a Linux system, the
					path should look something like this:
					<code>/tmp/build7671134933141820113.tmp</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Again, the other details of that command are not that
					interesting, as it will be replaced later.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Now we have an executable for our program, but we're still not
				done! The executable we built is in the
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>
				format. ELF is used on many operating systems, but for a
				bare-metal ARM board, we need something different:
			</p>

			<pre>
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary blink.elf blink.bin
			</pre>

			<p>
				This final command will convert the binary into the correct
				format. We can upload this to the Due using the method outlined
				in the <a href="/2015-04-11-manually-uploading-the-program">last
				article</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
bossac --write --verify --boot -R blink.bin
			</pre>

			<p>
				If everything worked out, the code will be uploaded to the board
				and you can keep watching the LED blinking to your heart's
				content. Don't forget that you need to erase the board before
				the upload (using the <code>ERASE</code> button).
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!
			</p>

				<p>
					Actually, I did sneak another change in: I've updated the
					timing of the blinking, so I can tell the difference between
					the <code>blink.ino</code> and <code>blink.c</code>
					programs once they are running on the board.
				</p>

				<a name="note-2"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[2]</span>
				<p>
					As I said before, I'm using Ubuntu, so I could simply
					install this via
					<code>sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi</code>. I'm
					pretty sure it is available on other platforms, too.
				</p>

				<a name="note-3"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[3]</span>
				<p>
					Even though we're in the process of removing the Arduino IDE
					from the build process, we're still using the Arduino
					libraries for our program. So for the time being, we still
					need to link them in.
