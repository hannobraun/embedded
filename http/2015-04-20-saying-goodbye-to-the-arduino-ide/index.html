			<h1>Saying Goodby to the Arduino IDE</h1>

			<p>
				<a href="/2015-04-13-getting-rid-of-the-arduino-libraries">Last
				time</a>, we got rid of the Arduino libraries and started
				talking to the hardware directly. We were still including some
				Arduino code in our program, however, and we relied on the
				Arduino IDE for building our program. All of this is changing
				today, so prepare to say goodby to Arduino!
			</p>

			<p>
				First, we need to add a few lines to our program:
			</p>

			<pre>
// blink.c

// Addresses of several registers used to control parallel I/O.
volatile int *pb_pio_enable          = (int *)0x400E1000;
volatile int *pb_output_enable       = (int *)0x400E1010;
volatile int *pb_set_output_data     = (int *)0x400E1030;
volatile int *pb_clear_output_data   = (int *)0x400E1034;

// Bit mask for PB27. This is pin 13 (the built-in LED) on the Arduino Due.
int pb27_mask = 0x08000000;

// Addresses of several registers used to control the real-time timer.
volatile int *timer_mode_register  = (int *)0x400E1A30;
volatile int *timer_value_register = (int *)0x400E1A38;


// As the name suggests, this function sleeps for a given number of
// milliseconds. Our replacement for Arduino's delay function.
void sleep_ms(int milliseconds) {
	int sleep_until = *timer_value_register + milliseconds;
	while (*timer_value_register &lt; sleep_until) {}
}

// The main function. A normal Arduino sketch would have setup and loop
// functions, which are normally called by Arduino's built-in main
// function. Our main here replaces all three of these.
int main() {
	// Enable PB27 (pin 13) and configure it for output.
	*pb_pio_enable    = pb27_mask;
	*pb_output_enable = pb27_mask;

	// Set the timer to a resolution of a millisecond.
	*timer_mode_register = 0x00000020;

	// Continuously set and clear output on PB27 (pin 13). This blinks
	// the Due's built-in LED, which is the single purpose of this
	// program.
	while (1) {
		*pb_set_output_data = pb27_mask;
		sleep_ms(200);
		*pb_clear_output_data = pb27_mask;
		sleep_ms(800);
	}
}

				The first part hasn't changed, but I've added a lot of functions
				at the end. Those are handler functions for various interrupts.
				We'll talk about where all those function names come from in a
				moment (and in later articles we'll talk a lot about interrupts
				in general), but for now, you just have to understand this:
				Interrupts can occur due to various events and when they do, one
				of these handler functions can be called. All of the handlers do
				the same, which is basically
				nothing<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Implementing those handlers allows us to drop the rest of the
				Arduino libraries and simplify our build process significantly.
				The two compile steps have been merged into one:
			</p>

			<pre>
arm-none-eabi-gcc \
	-nostdlib \
	-mcpu=cortex-m3 \
	-mthumb \
	-Tlinker-script.ld \
	-Wl,--entry=Reset_Handler \
	blink.c \
	libsam_sam3x8e_gcc_rel.a \
	-o blink.elf
			</pre>

			<p>
				Attentive readers will notice that there are still two files
				being included. The first is a linker script
				(<code>linker-script.ld</code>), which tells the linker the
				things it needs to know about the specific hardware on the
				Arduino Due<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>. I've
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/master/linker-script.ld">
				added it to the GitHub repository</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second is a library (<code>libsam_sam3x8e_gcc_rel.a</code>)
				that came with the Arduino IDE, but doesn't seem to be
				Arduino-specific. Rather, I think it belongs to the
				<a href="http://asf.atmel.com/docs/latest/">Atmel Software
				Framework</a><a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>. In
				there, the last bits of initialization code that I have yet to
				replace are still hiding.
			</p>

			<p>
				The rest of the build process is, again, unchanged:
			</p>

			<pre>
arm-none-eabi-objcopy \
	-O binary \
	blink.elf \
	blink.bin

bossac --write --verify --boot -R blink.bin
			</pre>

			<p>
				Please don't forget that you have to press the
				<code>ERASE</code> button on the Due before attempting to upload
				the program.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, another small but important step towards fully controlling
				what happens on the hardware. For the first time, someone can
				clone my <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">Git
				repository</a>, build the program and upload it to the board
				without having to install the Arduino IDE.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!
			</p>

					In a normal program, you could just exit if there's an error
					that you can't or don't want to handle. With embedded code
					that runs directly on the hardware, <em>exiting the
					program</em> is not a concept that makes any sense, as
					there's no operating system that could pick up where the
					program left off.
				</p>

				<p>
					That's why all those interrupt handler functions contain an
					endless loop, as this effectively stops all operation until
					someone restarts the board or uploads another program.
				</p>

				<p>
					To be honest, I don't quite understand everything that's
					going on in that linker script. Although I may revisit this
					at some point in the future, I'm fine with it for now. While
					I want full control over what's happening on the board, I
					don't have a lot of drive to understand all the details of
					the build process, beyond what's immediately useful to me.
				</p>

					<a href="http://www.atmel.com/">Atmel</a> is the
					manufacturer of the SAM3X8E SoC (system on chip) that forms
					the basis of the Arduino Due. They provide software to help
					programmers work with their hardware Arduino uses that and
					build their own stuff on top.
