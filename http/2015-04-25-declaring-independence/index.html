			<h1>Declaring Independence</h1>

			<p>
				In the
				<a href="/2015-04-23-saying-goodbye-to-the-arduino-ide">last
				article</a>, we finally took the build into our own hands. There
				was still a third-party library we relied on, however. No
				longer! Today is the day we're declaring independence and
				finally manage to run a program on the Arduino Due that solely
				consists of our own code.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before I knew how to achieve that, I needed to find out what
				exactly that third-party library
				(<code>libsam_sam3x8e_gcc_rel.a</code>) was doing. The only clue
				I had to go on was the entry point of our binary,
				<code>Reset_Handler</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Looking at the contents of the
				library<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>, I was able to
				find out that multiple object files had been linked together to
				form that library. <code>Reset_Handler</code> originally came
				from a file named <code>startup_sam3xa.o</code>. All the
				sections coming from other object files looked, by their names,
				like functions for accessing the hardware. Since I knew I was
				using none of those, I guessed that those other object files
				were irrelevant and could be ignored.
			</p>

			<p>
				I also guessed that the
				<a href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino">Arduino
				repository</a> would have the source code for the library. A bit
				of digging turned up five different files named
				<code>startup_sam3xa.c</code>. Some detective work then helped
				figure out which one was the right one:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The correct file would have to contain a
					<code>Reset_Handler</code> function.
				</li>
				<li>
					It would need to call our <code>main</code> function.
				</li>
				<li>
					Most of the files contained a call to
					<code>__libc_init_array</code>, which looks like it belongs
					to libc. Since we don't include that, those files could be
					ruled out.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				That left
				<a href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/master/hardware/arduino/sam/system/CMSIS/Device/ATMEL/sam3xa/source/gcc/startup_sam3xa.c">a single file</a>,
				which in addition contained comments referring to Arduino, so
				that one looked pretty good. What I did next was copy that file
				and all the header files it included into
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">my
				repository</a>. I then went on to cut out as much of that code
				as I could, without breaking the program.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eventually I was able to integrate what remained into
				<code>blink.c</code>. Let's look at what the file looks like
				now, part by part:
			</p>

			<pre>
// blink.c

// This is the top of the stack, as provided to us by the linker.
extern unsigned int _estack;


// This is a partial definition of the vector table. It only defines the
// first two entries which, as far as I can tell, are the minimum needed
// for a program to work at all.
// Space for the other interrupt handlers is reserved. I'm not sure if this
// is necessary, but I can imagine that the vector table not having the
// right length could cause all kinds of problems (imagine if it was too
// short, and the linker would place something else directly after it).
typedef struct {
	void *initial_stack_pointer_value;
	void *reset_handler;

	char other_interrupt_vectors[44 * 4]; // space for 44 32-bit pointers
} VectorTable;


void start();


// The vector table. We're using GCC-specific functionality to place this
// into the .vectors section, not where it would normally go (I suppose
// .rodata). The linker script makes sure that the .vectors section is at
// the right place.
__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))
const VectorTable vector_table = {
	(void *)(&amp;_estack),
	(void *)start,
};
			</pre>

			<p>
				Here we set up the vector table. When various things happen,
				for example an external I/O signal, or the system being reset,
				this can lead to an interrupt. An interrupt, as the name
				suggests, interrupts the normal execution of code and calls a
				handler function for that specific case.
			</p>

			<p>
				As you can see, I cheated as much as I could get away with.
				Instead of defining all 46 entries of the vector
				table<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>, I only defined
				the two I absolutely needed to get the program running: The
				initial value of the stack
				pointer<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a> and the reset
				handler.
			</p>

			<pre>
// blink.c, continued

// Addresses of several registers used to control parallel I/O.
static volatile int * const pb_pio_enable          = (int *)0x400E1000;
static volatile int * const pb_output_enable       = (int *)0x400E1010;
static volatile int * const pb_set_output_data     = (int *)0x400E1030;
static volatile int * const pb_clear_output_data   = (int *)0x400E1034;

// Bit mask for PB27. This is pin 13 (the built-in LED) on the Arduino Due.
static const int pb27_mask = 0x08000000;

// Addresses of several registers used to control the real-time timer.
static volatile int * const timer_mode_register  = (int *)0x400E1A30;
static volatile int * const timer_value_register = (int *)0x400E1A38;
			</pre>

			<p>
				This is about the same as before, with one crucial difference:
				Previously, those have been global variables. Now they are
				constants. The difference is important, as global variables end
				up in a section of the executable called <code>.data</code>,
				while constants go into <code>.rodata</code>. The contents of
				the <code>.data</code> section require some special handling,
				which I've omitted for
				now<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>.
			</p>

			<pre>
// blink.c, continued

// As the name suggests, this function sleeps for a given number of
// milliseconds. Our replacement for Arduino's delay function.
void sleep_ms(int milliseconds) {
	int sleep_until = *timer_value_register + milliseconds;
	while (*timer_value_register &lt; sleep_until) {}
}

// This function is the entry point for our application and the handler
// function for the reset interrupt.
void start() {
	// Enable PB27 (pin 13) and configure it for output.
	*pb_pio_enable    = pb27_mask;
	*pb_output_enable = pb27_mask;

	// Set the timer to a resolution of a millisecond.
	*timer_mode_register = 0x00000020;

	// Continuously set and clear output on PB27 (pin 13). This blinks
	// the Due's built-in LED, which is the single purpose of this
	// program.
	while (1) {
		*pb_set_output_data = pb27_mask;
		sleep_ms(200);
		*pb_clear_output_data = pb27_mask;
		sleep_ms(800);
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This part stayed almost the same, except that I've renamed
				<code>main</code> to <code>start</code>, which I like better.
			</p>

			<p>
				There's a very important thing to note here: As I've mentioned
				above, I've omitted some very important pieces of initialization
				code. We happen to get away with this, because this program
				doesn't use any global variables. I've added two
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/606e96cf208ef2eab04c6e2fa6dc616c2e8b840a/blink.c#L58">extensive
				comments</a> to the full version of the file, so check those out
				if you're interested in the details of my reasoning.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it! This program can be compiled and uploaded to the
				Arduino Due with the following commands:
			</p>

			<pre>
arm-none-eabi-gcc \
	-nostdlib \
	-mcpu=cortex-m3 \
	-mthumb \
	-Tlinker-script.ld \
	-Wl,--entry=start \
	blink.c \
	-o blink.elf

arm-none-eabi-objcopy \
	-O binary \
	blink.elf \
	blink.bin

bossac --write --verify --boot -R blink.bin
			</pre>

			<p>
				Please don't forget that you have to press the
				<code>ERASE</code> button on the Arduino Due before you can
				upload the program.
			</p>

			<p>
				There's one nice detail I want to mention before closing up this
				article. Here's what <code>bossac</code> printed when we
				<a href="/2015-04-11-manually-uploading-the-program">first used
				it to upload the program</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
Device found on ttyACM3
Write 11952 bytes to flash
[==============================] 100% (47/47 pages)
Verify 11952 bytes of flash
[==============================] 100% (47/47 pages)
Verify successful
Set boot flash true
CPU reset.
			</pre>

			<p>
				And here's the output from uploading today's program:
			</p>

			<pre>
Device found on ttyACM3
Write 352 bytes to flash
[==============================] 100% (2/2 pages)
Verify 352 bytes of flash
[==============================] 100% (2/2 pages)
Verify successful
Set boot flash true
CPU reset.
			</pre>

			<p>
				Yes, you're reading that right. Even though the program does the
				same as it did before, blinking the LED, the size has been
				reduced by 97%! Of course, it will all go downhill from here.
				The program is bound to grow again, as we build up our own
				abstractions to access the hardware.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!

					As I mentioned previously, I'm using Linux (Ubuntu 14.04, to
					be specific). On Linux, there are a few useful tools for
					analyzing compiled binaries.
				</p>

				<p>
					To see the whole contents of the library as assembler code,
					you can use the platform-specific version of the
					<code>objdump</code> tool.
					<code>arm-none-eabi-objdump -D libsam_sam3x8e_gcc_rel.a</code>
					worked for me. To see the symbols the different sections
					define, use <code>-t</code> instead of <code>-D</code>. To
					simply print a list of all defined symbols use
					<code>nm</code> (<code>nm libsam_sam3x8e_gcc_rel.a</code>).
				</p>

				<p>
					A word on documentation: Even though I have
					<code>arm-none-eabi-objdump</code> installed on my system,
					there doesn't seem to be a man page specifically for it.
					That doesn't matter, however, as <code>man objdump</code>
					has all the information you need.
				</p>

				<a name="note-2"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[2]</span>
				<p>
					The vector table is defined in the
					<a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-11057-32-bit-Cortex-M3-Microcontroller-SAM3X-SAM3A_Datasheet.pdf">reference documentation</a>
					for the SAM3X8E (that's the SoC on the Arduino Due). See
					section 10.6.4.

					I think I'm just going to assume everyone knows what the
					stack is and how it works. If you don't,
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">read
					up</a>!
				</p>

				<a name="note-4"></a>

				<p>
					This is one of those details you never ever think about when
					doing "regular" programming: How exactly do global variables
					work?
				</p>

				<p>
					When you define a global variable with an initial value,
					that initial value has to be part of your executable, so it
					can be available at runtime. But what if you want to assign
					a new value to the variable? I'm not sure what the situation
					is on desktop platforms, but the SAM3X8E has a separate
					program memory where the program is executed from. You can
					hardly just write the new value there, or future instances
					of your program would be started with the new value instead
					of the initial one you defined in your source code.
				</p>

				<p>
					The solution is actually pretty straight-forward: Some piece
					of code has to copy those global variables into RAM at the
					start of the program. The linker makes sure all parts of
					your program that use the global variables will know about
					the address in RAM.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are lots of places around the Internet that talk about
					this topic, but
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computing%29">Wikipedia
					seems like a good place to start</a>.
