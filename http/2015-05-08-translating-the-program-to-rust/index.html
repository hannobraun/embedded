			<h1>Translating the Program to Rust</h1>

			<p>
				<a href="/2015-04-30-building-with-llvm">Last time</a>, I
				announced my new goal: Programming my
				<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue">Arduino
				Due</a> with <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>. Getting
				started with that turned out to be surprisingly easy. Since the
				C program doesn't have any dependencies and consists only of a
				single file, there was only one problem to solve: Translating
				the program to Rust and figuring out how to build that.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before we take a look at the new program, two notes:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					I've deleted the old C program from
					<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">the
					repository</a>, but thanks to the wonders of version
					control, you can always access the
					<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/75831e9ba671d8f5c4aa9d0a9a83137820c94477/blink.c">last
					version of the C program</a>. It might be helpful to refer
					back to it while reading the article, to compare the old C code
					with the new Rust code.
				</li>
				<li>
					From here on out, I'm going to assume a basic familiarity
					with Rust, just like I previously assumed a basic
					familiarity with C. I'll attempt to explain the weird stuff,
					but I will just take it for granted that you can understand
					"normal" Rust code. If you don't know Rust but still want to
					follow along, the
					<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/">official
					documentation</a> is a good place to start learning.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Okay then, without further ado, let's get to the program!
			</p>

			<pre>
#![feature(intrinsics, lang_items, no_std)]
			</pre>

			<p>
				Before we're doing anything else, we need to opt into a few
				language features that we're going to use. While the Rust
				developers promise not to break compatibility in the stable
				subset of the
				language<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>, we need some
				unstable features for our use case, which requires an explicit
				opt-in.
			</p>

			<p>
				This also means that our program will only work with a nightly
				version of Rust, since unstable features are not available in
				stable releases.
			</p>

			<pre>
#![no_main]
#![no_std]
			</pre>

			<p>
				Here we're telling the compiler two things.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Even though this is a program, we won't use a main
					functions. Normal programs have an entry point that gets
					executed after they are started. This doesn't make a lot of
					sense for a program running on bare metal, without an
					operating system. Our program's entry point is the handler
					for the reset interrupt, which we will need to set up
					ourselves.
				</li>
				<li>
					We don't want to use the standard library. While very
					useful, Rust's standard library contains a lot of
					functionality (like files and networking) that isn't
					applicable to embedded
					development<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<pre>
extern "rust-intrinsic" {
	fn overflowing_add<T>(a: T, b: T) -> T;
	fn u32_sub_with_overflow(x: u32, y: u32) -> (u32, bool);
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Here we're declaring some intrinsic functions that are provided
				to us by the compiler. Rust relies a lot on library code to
				provide even basic functionality and, by itself, is even more
				limited than C in a lot of ways. Specifically, even basic
				operators like <code>+</code> and <code>&lt;</code> are not
				available without building some basic infrastructure first.
			</p>

			<p>
				For now, we're working around this problem by not using those
				operators and relying on intrinsic functions instead.
			</p>

			<pre>
#[lang = "copy"]
trait Copy {}
#[lang = "sized"]
trait Sized {}
#[lang = "sync"]
trait Sync {}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This is another example of Rust not really being able to do
				anything without basic infrastructure. Here we're defining a few
				traits that are used to mark types.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					A type marked with <code>Copy</code> can be copied from one
					place to another, as opposed to being moved by changing
					ownership.
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>Sized</code> means that the type's size is known at
					compile time.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <code>Sync</code> type can be accessed safely from
					multiple threads.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				None is this is particularly relevant to our program, but those
				concepts are so basic to Rust that the compiler won't be able to
				compile a program without them being defined. Since we said
				above that we don't want the compiler to link the standard
				library, we need to provide this kind of stuff ourselves.
			</p>

			<pre>
#[no_mangle]
pub fn __aeabi_unwind_cpp_pr0() {
	loop {}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				I'm not so sure what this function is, but the Rust compiler
				writes references to it into the executable, so if it isn't
				defined somewhere, the program won't link. I think this is
				related to stack unwinding, a thing that needs to happen if the
				program panics, that is, encounters an
				unrecoverable<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a> error.
			</p>

			<p>
				 For our purpose, this stub implementation that just loops
				 forever is more than
				 enough<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>. At some point
				 we'll need better error handling, but let's not get ahead of
				 ourselves.
			</p>

			<pre>
// This is the top of the stack, as provided to us by the linker.
extern {
	static _estack: u32;
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				So much for weird Rust-specific stuff. This is something we
				recognize from our C program! From here on out, everything will
				be, more or less, a straight translation.
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct VectorTable {
	pub initial_stack_pointer_value: &amp;'static u32,
	pub reset_handler              : fn(),

	pub other_interrupt_vectors: [u32; 44],
}

impl Sync for VectorTable {}
			</pre>

			<p>
				The definition of the vector table type. The only difference to
				the C code is that the types are a bit more strict. This wasn't
				required in C, as C allows us to just cast one type to another
				willy-nilly. Rust is a bit more strict, hence the more accurate
				types.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since we're going to save the vector table in a global variable,
				we need to implement the <code>Sync</code> trait for it, thereby
				promising the Rust compiler that it'll be safe to access it from
				multiple threads.
			</p>

			<pre>
// The vector table. We're telling the compiler to place this into .vectors
// section, not where it would normally go (I suppose .rodata). The linker
// script makes sure that the .vectors section is at the right place.
#[link_section=".vectors"]
pub static VECTOR_TABLE: VectorTable = VectorTable {
	initial_stack_pointer_value: &amp;_estack,
	reset_handler              : start,
	other_interrupt_vectors    : [0; 44],
};
			</pre>

			<p>
				Safe for the slightly different syntax, this is exactly the same
				as it was in the C program.
			</p>

			<pre>
// Addresses of several registers used to control parallel I/O.
const PB_PIO_ENABLE       : *mut u32 = 0x400E1000 as *mut u32;
const PB_OUTPUT_ENABLE    : *mut u32 = 0x400E1010 as *mut u32;
const PB_SET_OUTPUT_DATA  : *mut u32 = 0x400E1030 as *mut u32;
const PB_CLEAR_OUTPUT_DATA: *mut u32 = 0x400E1034 as *mut u32;

// Bit mask for PB27. This is pin 13 (the built-in LED) on the Arduino Due.
const PB27_MASK: u32 = 0x08000000;

// Addresses of several registers used to control the real-time timer.
const TIMER_MODE_REGISTER : *mut   u32 = 0x400E1A30 as *mut   u32;
const TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER: *const u32 = 0x400E1A38 as *const u32;
			</pre>

			<p>
				More straight-forward translation. The only thing to note is
				that those <code>*mut</code> and <code>*const</code> pointers
				are not the pointer types we would use in regular Rust code.
				Instead, they are so-called unsafe pointers, specifically meant
				for interacting with C code (or in this case, low-level
				hardware).
			</p>

			<pre>
fn sleep_ms(milliseconds: u32) {
	unsafe {
		let sleep_until = overflowing_add(
			*TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER,
			milliseconds
		);

		let mut sleep = true;
		while sleep {
			let (_, overflow) = u32_sub_with_overflow(
				sleep_until,
				*TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER
			);
			sleep = !overflow;
		}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				The sleep function has changed a bit, and not for the better. As
				I explained above, we can't use basic operators yet, so I had to
				get a bit creative with intrinsic functions. We'll clean this up
				later.
			</p>

			<pre>
fn start() {
	unsafe {
		// Enable PB27 (pin 13) and configure it for output.
		*PB_PIO_ENABLE    = PB27_MASK;
		*PB_OUTPUT_ENABLE = PB27_MASK;

		// Set the timer to a resolution of a millisecond.
		*TIMER_MODE_REGISTER = 0x00000020;

		// Continuously set and clear output on PB27 (pin 13). This
		// blinks the Due's built-in LED, which is the single
		// purpose of this program.
		loop {
			*PB_SET_OUTPUT_DATA = PB27_MASK;
			sleep_ms(200);
			*PB_CLEAR_OUTPUT_DATA = PB27_MASK;
			sleep_ms(800);
		}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				And the <code>start</code> function. Again, pretty much the same
				as it used to be in C. The main difference is that Rust
				considers our dereferencing of unsafe pointers to be an unsafe
				operation. Hence, the <code>unsafe</code> block, which is just a
				promise to the compiler that we paid really close attention to
				what happens within the block and that it can treat the
				<code>start</code> function as safe, even though it contains
				unsafe code.
			</p>

			<p>
				The build command is pretty straight-forward:
			</p>

			<pre>
rustc \
	--target=target.json \
	-C link-args="-Tlinker-script.ld" \
	-o blink.elf \
	blink.rs
			</pre>

			<p>
				The command refers to the file <code>target.json</code> which
				contains all the nasty platform-specific
				details<a class="footnote" href="#note-5">[5]</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
{
	"data-layout"         : "e-p:32:32:32-i1:8:8-i8:8:8-i16:16:16-i32:32:32-i64:64:64-f32:32:32-f64:64:64-v64:64:64-v128:64:128-a:0:64-n32",
	"llvm-target"         : "thumbv7m-unknown-none-eabi",
	"linker"              : "arm-none-eabi-gcc",
	"target-endian"       : "little",
	"target-pointer-width": "32",
	"arch"                : "armv7-m",
	"os"                  : "none",
	"executables"         : true
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Some of it is straight-forward, some of it looks like black
				magic. Following established tradition, I'm not going to fret
				too much about this for now. My goal remains to understand
				what's going on with my program running on the hardware.
				Whatever sorcery is required to build the program in the first
				place is only of secondary
				concern<a class="footnote" href="#note-6">[6]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The rest of the build process has, yet again, remained
				unchanged. I'm not going to repeat it any more.The
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/e8d0cbf840e5a5ba68650dbd02c2d859987487c3/upload">full
				build script</a> is available in the repository.
			</p>

			<p>
				One piece is still missing. The Rust compiler tries to link to a
				file called <code>libcompiler-rt.a</code>. If it's not
				available, the build fails. I did a bit of research and
				identified this as the
				<a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt Runtime
				library</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In a bit of sly thinking that I'm quite proud of, I thought
				that, since I'm not using anything from that library (that I
				know of), maybe I can just create an empty library to shut the
				compiler up? Turns out I can!
			</p>

			<pre>
ar m libcompiler-rt.a
			</pre>

			<p>
				Using the <code>ar</code> command, you can create an empty
				library, which, for now, is enough to satisfy the Rust compiler.
			</p>

			<p>
				And that's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!
