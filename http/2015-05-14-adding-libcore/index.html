			<h1>Adding libcore</h1>

			<p>
				In the
				<a href="/2015-05-08-translating-the-program-to-rust">last
				article</a>, we translated our C program to Rust. The resulting
				Rust code, however, was kind of a mess. It had to use weird
				intrinsic functions for basic tasks, that simple operators would
				have been more suited for.
			</p>

			<p>
				As I explained back then, the reason for this is that the Rust
				language relies on its standard library for a lot of very basic
				features, that in other languages are built into the language
				itself. And of course, we couldn't just use Rust's standard
				library, as it is designed to be run on top of an operating
				system.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a solution though: While Rust's standard library looks
				like a monolithic block from the outside, it actually is very
				modular, built up from a few different libraries under the hood.
				The most basic of those is
				<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/index.html"><code>libcore</code></a>.
				<code>libcore</code> provides basic pieces of functionality,
				while being completely platform-agnostic. It doesn't even rely
				a heap being
				available<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>, making it
				suitable for event the most constrained of embedded platforms.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before I show you how to use it though, I'd like to talk about
				my motivation first. So far, I've insisted on removing all
				third-party libraries and replaced them with custom code. Why
				not re-implement <code>libcore</code>, as we re-implemented
				those other libraries?
			</p>

			<p>
				The answer to this question is pretty simple: Re-implementing
				<code>libcore</code> would teach us about Rust, but my goal here
				is to learn about the hardware. The libraries that we removed up
				till now took away our control. <code>libcore</code> is
				different, in that is provides us with tools to help write our
				code without obscuring what is happening. If any of you are
				interested in the inner workings of Rust, then writing your own
				<code>libcore</code> is probably a great project. But it's out
				of scope for what I'm doing here.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that this is out of the way, let's get to the new program:
			</p>

			<pre>
#![feature(core, intrinsics, lang_items, no_std)]

#![no_main]
#![no_std]
			</pre>

			<p>
				The only change in our header here is that <code>core</code> has
				been added to the list of features. <code>libcore</code> is
				still considered unstable, which means it might be changed in
				future versions. We need to declare the unstable features we
				need before the compiler lets us use
				them<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
			</p>

			<pre>
extern crate core;

use core::prelude::*;
			</pre>

			<p>
				Here we're declaring that we want to use <code>libcore</code>
				and import everything from its prelude. Normally, we have to
				include everything we'd like to use explicitly. The prelude
				contains types and functions from <code>libcore</code> that are
				so essential that every program should have access to them.
			</p>

			<pre>
#[lang = "panic_fmt"]
pub extern fn panic_fmt() { loop {} }

#[lang = "stack_exhausted"]
pub extern fn stack_exhausted() { loop {} }

#[lang = "eh_personality"]
pub extern fn eh_personality() { loop {} }
			</pre>

			<p>
				These functions are used in <code>libcore</code>, but can't be
				defined there. <code>libcore</code> can't know their appropriate
				implementations. For example, code within <code>libcore</code>
				should be able to cause a program panic. What that actually
				means though, depends on the platform. On a desktop operating system, a
				panicking process would print an error message and stop
				executing. For our case, just stopping the program (by looping
				forever) is good enough for now.
			</p>

			<pre>
#[no_mangle] pub extern fn __aeabi_unwind_cpp_pr0() { loop {} }
			</pre>

			<p>
				Unfortunately we still have to declare this mystery function.
				There's one important change to it: To make the function usable
				by code from <code>libcore</code>, it needs to be public (the
				<code>pub extern</code> bit).
			</p>

			<pre>
// This is the top of the stack, as provided to us by the linker.
extern {
	static _estack: u32;
}


// Type declaration for the vector table.
pub struct VectorTable {
	pub initial_stack_pointer_value: &amp;'static u32,
	pub reset_handler              : fn(),

	pub other_interrupt_vectors: [u32; 44],
}

unsafe impl Sync for VectorTable {}


// The actual vector table.
#[link_section=".vectors"]
pub static VECTOR_TABLE: VectorTable = VectorTable {
	initial_stack_pointer_value: &amp;_estack,
	reset_handler              : start,
	other_interrupt_vectors    : [0; 44],
};


// Addresses of several registers used to control parallel I/O.
const PB_PIO_ENABLE       : *mut u32 = 0x400E1000 as *mut u32;
const PB_OUTPUT_ENABLE    : *mut u32 = 0x400E1010 as *mut u32;
const PB_SET_OUTPUT_DATA  : *mut u32 = 0x400E1030 as *mut u32;
const PB_CLEAR_OUTPUT_DATA: *mut u32 = 0x400E1034 as *mut u32;

// Bit mask for PB27. This is pin 13 (the built-in LED) on the Arduino Due.
const PB27_MASK: u32 = 0x08000000;

// Addresses of several registers used to control the real-time timer.
const TIMER_MODE_REGISTER : *mut   u32 = 0x400E1A30 as *mut   u32;
const TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER: *const u32 = 0x400E1A38 as *const u32;
			</pre>

			<p>
				All of this is largely unchanged, and there's not a lot to say
				about it.
			</p>

			<pre>
// As the name suggests, this function sleeps for a given number of
// milliseconds. Our replacement for Arduino's delay function.
fn sleep_ms(milliseconds: u32) {
	unsafe {
		let sleep_until = *TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER + milliseconds;
		while *TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER &lt; sleep_until {}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This is a nice example of what <code>libcore</code> does for us.
				After the translation from C, this function became really weird,
				having to use intrinsic compiler functions. Now with
				<code>libcore</code>, we can use operators like <code>+</code>
				and <code>&lt;</code> again.
			</p>

			<pre>
// This function is the entry point for our application and the handler
// function for the reset interrupt.
fn start() {
	unsafe {
		// Enable PB27 (pin 13) and configure it for output.
		*PB_PIO_ENABLE    = PB27_MASK;
		*PB_OUTPUT_ENABLE = PB27_MASK;

		// Set the timer to a resolution of a millisecond.
		*TIMER_MODE_REGISTER = 0x00000020;

		// Continuously set and clear output on PB27 (pin 13). This
		// blinks the Due's built-in LED, which is the single
		// purpose of this program.
		loop {
			*PB_SET_OUTPUT_DATA = PB27_MASK;
			sleep_ms(200);
			*PB_CLEAR_OUTPUT_DATA = PB27_MASK;
			sleep_ms(800);
		}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				The rest of the program is also unchanged.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we have an updated program, we still need to build it.
				I'm developing on a x86-64 machine, so the <code>libcore</code>
				that comes with my installation of Rust has been compiled for
				that platform. Since we need an ARM version, we're going to have
				to build it ourselves. Fortunately, this is really easy: Just
				clone the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust
				repository</a><a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a> and
				build it with the following
				command<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
rustc \
	--target=target.json \
	-o output/libcore.rlib \
	vendor/rust/src/libcore/lib.rs
			</pre>

			<p>
				This requires an <code>output</code> directory to work, so be
				sure to create that first. <code>target.json</code> refers to
				the same
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/ccf9356da68cc50aa3595d9729212dcfdf7b8206/target.json">target
				specification</a> used in the last article, with one minor
				change: I had to change <code>arch</code> from
				<code>armv7-m</code> to the less specific <code>arm</code>. I
				don't know why that's required, as our own program works with
				both settings. <code>libcore</code> wouldn't compile without
				that change though.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once <code>libcore</code> is compiled, we can build our program:
			</p>

			<pre>
rustc \
	--target=target.json \
	-C link-args="-Tlinker-script.ld" \
	-L output \
	-o output/blink.elf \
	blink/blink.rs
			</pre>

			<p>
				This command is essentially unchanged, except that we have to tell
				the Rust compiler to look in the <code>output</code> directory
				for libraries. The
				<a a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/ccf9356da68cc50aa3595d9729212dcfdf7b8206/upload">rest
				of the program upload</a> is, yet again, unchanged.
			</p>

			<p>
				And that's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!
			</p>
