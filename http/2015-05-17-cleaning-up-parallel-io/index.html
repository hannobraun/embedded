			<h1>Cleaning Up Parallel I/O</h1>

			<p>
				<a href="/2015-05-14-adding-libcore">Last time</a>, we added
				Rust's <code>libcore</code> to our program, enabling us to write
				idiomatic Rust code that runs on a microcontroller. This
				provides us with a good base for extending our program in the
				future. However, before we go ahead and make it do something
				else than blinking an LED, I'd like to do some cleaning up
				first.
			</p>

			<p>
				When I started to make the LED blink in the first place, I
				didn't really explain how I was doing it. I just wrote some
				cryptic code with the promise to explain it later. Well,
				<em>later</em> has finally arrived.
			</p>

			<p>
				As I explained before, I'm using an
				<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue">Arduino
				Due</a> board for development. The Due uses Atmel's
				<a href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/SAM3X8E.aspx">SAM3X8E</a>
				microcontroller. Atmel provides a very thorough
				<a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-11057-32-bit-Cortex-M3-Microcontroller-SAM3X-SAM3A_Datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a>, which I'm going to refer to throughout the
				rest of this article.
			</p>

			<p>
				For blinking the LED, we're using a feature called <em>Parallel
				I/O</em>. Parallel I/O allows us to set an electric signal on
				the various I/O pins. One of those pins is wired to the built-in
				LED on the Arduino Due. To blink the LED, we simply have to
				repeatedly set and clear the signal on that pin.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's take a look at some of the constants we define in our
				program:
			</p>

			<pre>
const PB_PIO_ENABLE       : *mut u32 = 0x400E1000 as *mut u32;
const PB_OUTPUT_ENABLE    : *mut u32 = 0x400E1010 as *mut u32;
const PB_SET_OUTPUT_DATA  : *mut u32 = 0x400E1030 as *mut u32;
const PB_CLEAR_OUTPUT_DATA: *mut u32 = 0x400E1034 as *mut u32;
			</pre>

			<p>
				ARM microcontrollers, which the SAM3X8E is an example of, use a
				technique called
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O">memory-mapped
				I/O</a> for controlling input/output. This means, as opposed to
				having to use special CPU instruction, a program writes to or
				reads from specific memory addresses to perform I/O functions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Those addresses aren't actually mapped to RAM, so writing to
				them won't change a value in main memory. Instead, the hardware
				recognizes that the program wrote to a special address and
				performs whatever function is associated with that address.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the piece of code above, we define 4 of those addresses
				(called registers)<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>PB_PIO_ENABLE</code> allows us to enable
					pins<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>. Pins need to
					be enabled before we can use them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using <code>PB_OUTPUT_ENABLE</code>, we can enable output on
					a specific pin<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>.
					Parallel I/O can also be used to sense electrical signals
					from external hardware. We have to tell the system whether
					we intend to use a pin to sense incoming signals, or to set
					them ourselves.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally, <code>PB_SET_OUTPUT_DATA</code> and
					<code>PB_CLEAR_OUTPUT_DATA</code> can be used to control the
					electrical signal on the pin by respectively setting or
					clearing it<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				To do anything with those registers, we need to know which
				values to write into them. Here's another constant from our
				program:
			</p>

			<pre>
const PB27_MASK: u32 = 0x08000000;
			</pre>

			<p>
				Each of the registers is 32 bits long, which means they can be
				used to control up to 32 different pins. The pin that is wired
				to the built-in LED is pin 27<a class="footnote" href="#note-5">[5]</a><a class="footnote" href="#note-6">[6]</a>.
				If you were to write the above constant in binary, it would be
				all zeros, except for the one bit that identifies pin 27.
			</p>

			<p>
				To do something with the pin, we just write the above constant
				into one of the
				registers<a class="footnote" href="#note-7">[7]</a>. Here's the
				code that does that:
			</p>

			<pre>
*PB_PIO_ENABLE    = PB27_MASK;
*PB_OUTPUT_ENABLE = PB27_MASK;

loop {
	*PB_SET_OUTPUT_DATA = PB27_MASK;
	sleep_ms(200);
	*PB_CLEAR_OUTPUT_DATA = PB27_MASK;
	sleep_ms(800);
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				We enable pin 27 and set it to output mode. Then we set and
				clear the pin in a loop (with pauses in between), thereby
				causing the LED to blink.
			</p>

			<p>
				This code does what it's supposed to in a straight-forward way.
				There are some problems with it, however:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					There are many more registers for the various features of
					Parallel I/O. We don't need those yet, but it would be nice
					to have them all available going forward.
				</li>
				<li>
					The SAM3X8E has a lot more than 32 pins (144 to be exact).
					To make all of those accessible, it has multiple <em>PIO
					controllers</em>, each with one set of registers. If we
					had to repeat all the constant above for each controller,
					that would be a lot of code to write.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Luckily, there's a better approach. Since the registers of a
				controller are located next to each other, we can use a struct
				to access them:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct Pio {
	pub pio_enable : u32,
	pub pio_disable: u32,
	pub pio_status : u32,

	pub _reserved_1: u32,

	pub output_enable : u32,
	pub output_disable: u32,
	pub output_status : u32,

	pub _reserved_2: u32,

	pub glitch_input_filter_enable : u32,
	pub glitch_input_filter_disable: u32,
	pub glitch_input_filter_status : u32,

	pub _reserved_3: u32,

	pub set_output_data   : u32,
	pub clear_output_data : u32,
	pub output_data_status: u32,
	pub pin_data_status   : u32,

	pub interrupt_enable : u32,
	pub interrupt_disable: u32,
	pub interrupt_mask   : u32,
	pub interrupt_status : u32,

	pub multi_driver_enable : u32,
	pub multi_driver_disable: u32,
	pub multi_driver_status : u32,

	pub _reserved_4: u32,

	pub pull_up_disable   : u32,
	pub pull_up_enable    : u32,
	pub pad_pull_up_status: u32,

	pub _reserved_5: u32,

	pub peripheral_ab_select: u32,

	pub _reserved_6: [u32; 3],

	pub system_clock_glitch_input_filter_select                 : u32,
	pub debouncing_input_filter_select                          : u32,
	pub glitch_or_debouncing_input_filter_clock_selection_status: u32,
	pub slow_clock_divider_debouncing                           : u32,

	pub _reserved_7: [u32; 4],

	pub output_write_enable : u32,
	pub output_write_disable: u32,
	pub output_write_status : u32,

	pub _reserved_8: u32,

	pub additional_interrupt_modes_enable : u32,
	pub additional_interrupt_modes_disable: u32,
	pub additional_interrupt_modes_mask   : u32,

	pub _reserved_9: u32,

	pub edge_select      : u32,
	pub level_select     : u32,
	pub edge_level_status: u32,

	pub _reserved_a: u32,

	pub falling_edge_low_level_select: u32,
	pub rising_edge_high_level_select: u32,
	pub fall_rise_low_high_status    : u32,

	pub _reserved_b: u32,

	pub lock_status         : u32,
	pub write_protect_mode  : u32,
	pub write_protect_status: u32,
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Now we can just provide the base address for each
				controller<a class="footnote" href="#note-8">[8]</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub const PIO_A: *mut Pio = 0x400E0E00 as *mut Pio;
pub const PIO_B: *mut Pio = 0x400E1000 as *mut Pio;
pub const PIO_C: *mut Pio = 0x400E1200 as *mut Pio;
pub const PIO_D: *mut Pio = 0x400E1400 as *mut Pio;
pub const PIO_E: *mut Pio = 0x400E1600 as *mut Pio;
pub const PIO_F: *mut Pio = 0x400E1800 as *mut Pio;
			</pre>

			<p>
				And finally, let's be thorough and define constants to access
				all of the up to 32 pins per controller:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub const P0 : u32 = 0x00000001;
pub const P1 : u32 = 0x00000002;
pub const P2 : u32 = 0x00000004;
pub const P3 : u32 = 0x00000008;
pub const P4 : u32 = 0x00000010;
pub const P5 : u32 = 0x00000020;
pub const P6 : u32 = 0x00000040;
pub const P7 : u32 = 0x00000080;
pub const P8 : u32 = 0x00000100;
pub const P9 : u32 = 0x00000200;
pub const P10: u32 = 0x00000400;
pub const P11: u32 = 0x00000800;
pub const P12: u32 = 0x00001000;
pub const P13: u32 = 0x00002000;
pub const P14: u32 = 0x00004000;
pub const P15: u32 = 0x00008000;
pub const P16: u32 = 0x00010000;
pub const P17: u32 = 0x00020000;
pub const P18: u32 = 0x00040000;
pub const P19: u32 = 0x00080000;
pub const P20: u32 = 0x00100000;
pub const P21: u32 = 0x00200000;
pub const P22: u32 = 0x00400000;
pub const P23: u32 = 0x00800000;
pub const P24: u32 = 0x01000000;
pub const P25: u32 = 0x02000000;
pub const P26: u32 = 0x04000000;
pub const P27: u32 = 0x08000000;
pub const P28: u32 = 0x10000000;
pub const P29: u32 = 0x20000000;
pub const P30: u32 = 0x40000000;
pub const P31: u32 = 0x80000000;
			</pre>

			<p>
				Done! Now we can access all of the features of all the available
				parallel I/O controllers. The updated LED blinking code doesn't
				look much different from before:
			</p>

			<pre>
(*PIO_B).pio_enable    = P27;
(*PIO_B).output_enable = P27;

loop {
	(*PIO_B).set_output_data = P27;
	sleep_ms(200);
	(*PIO_B).clear_output_data = P27;
	sleep_ms(800);
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available

				See you next time!

					In the Arduino world, this pin is referred to as pin 13.
					Here's a
					<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/PinMappingSAM3X">handy
					table that defines the pin mapping</a> between Arduino pin
					names and SAM3X8E pin names.
				</p>

				<a name="note-6"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[6]</span>
				<p>
					Pins are being counted from 0. Pin 0 is identified by the
					least significant bit. This means to do something with pin
					0, you would have to set the 1st of the 32 bits. To do
					something with pin 27, you would have to set the 28th of the
					32.
				</p>

				<a name="note-7"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[7]</span>
				<p>
					We could also manipulate multiple pins at once, by writing a
					value that has multiple bits set. If you don't know them
					already, I suggest you read up on
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation">bitwise
					operators</a>, as they are very useful for this kind of
					stuff.

					Not all of those controllers are actually available on the
					SAM3X8E, but it doesn't hurt to define them. Plus, it adds
					support for other members of the SAM3X family (the SAM3X8H
