			<h1>Cleaning Up The Timer Code</h1>

			<p>
				In <a href="/2015-05-17-cleaning-up-parallel-io">yesterday's
				article</a>, I explained the Parallel I/O (PIO) code and
				presented a cleaned up version. Today I'm going to to the same
				for the code that uses the Real-time Timer (RTT).
			</p>

			<p>
				First, let's take a look at the constants for the RTT that are
				defined in our program:
			</p>

			<pre>
const TIMER_MODE_REGISTER : *mut   u32 = 0x400E1A30 as *mut   u32;
const TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER: *const u32 = 0x400E1A38 as *const u32;
			</pre>

			<p>
				Just like PIO, the RTT can be controlled using memory-mapped
				I/O<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>. Two registers are
				defined here:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>TIMER_MODE_REGISTER</code> can be used to configure
					the RTT before it is being
					used<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER</code> holds, as its name
					suggests, the current value of the
					timer<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Here's the code that configures the timer using
				<code>TIMER_MODE_REGISTER</code>:
			</p>

			<pre>
*TIMER_MODE_REGISTER = 0x00000020;
			</pre>

			<p>
				The timer mode register consists of two halves (16 bits each):
				Only the lower half is of concern to us. It is used to set the
				Real-time Timer Prescaler Value (RTPRES).
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's how that works: The Real-time Timer is powered by a clock
				source called Slow Clock
				(SCLK)<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>, which is the
				only permanently running clock in the
				system<a class="footnote" href="#note-5">[5]</a>. This means
				that while other clocks might be disabled when the system enters
				a low-power mode, the slow clock will keep running and can be
				used to wake the system up again.
			</p>

			<p>
				None of this is very relevant for us right now. What we need to
				know is that the Slow Clock runs at a frequency of 32,768 Hz.
				However, the Real-time timer is not updated at that frequency.
				If it were, the timer value register would overflow every ~36
				hours<a class="footnote" href="#note-6">[6]</a>, which might be
				too often, depending on the application.
			</p>

			<p>
				To solve this problem, the RTT allows us to set the prescaler
				value. The update rate is divided by the prescaler value. For
				example, a value of 2 gives us overflows roughly every 73 hours
				while halving our timer accuracy.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since our use case is just to blink an LED, we don't need a very
				high accuracy. And unless we plan to blink that LED continuously
				for many days, neither do we care about an overflow of the timer
				register<a class="footnote" href="#note-7">[7]</a>. For
				convenience, I opted to set the prescaler value to 32 (0x20 in
				hexadecimal<a class="footnote" href="#note-8">[8]</a>). That
				gives us a resolution of around one millisecond.
			</p>

			<p>
				But enough exposition, let's get to the last missing piece of
				code:
			</p>

			<pre>
fn sleep_ms(milliseconds: u32) {
	unsafe {
		let sleep_until = *TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER + milliseconds;
		while *TIMER_VALUE_REGISTER &lt; sleep_until {}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This function computes the value the timer has to reach before
				it is allowed to return and then simply keeps checking the timer
				until it reaches that value. There are several problems with
				this approach:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This technique is called busy waiting and it requires a lot 
					of power, as the CPU is constantly busy during the wait. It
					would be much better to change into a power-saving mode and
					wake up via interrupt when the right time has come.
				</li>
				<li>
					It doesn't take the aforementioned overflow of the timer
					value register into
					account<a class="footnote" href="#note-9">[9]</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					It isn't completely accurate. With our prescaler value of
					32, the timer value register updates 1024 times a second,
					which means the function will wake up a bit too early.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Since all we're doing right now is blink an LED, none of those
				shortcomings are really relevant for us. At some point in the
				future, we are going to need a more robust implementation of
				this function. But for now, it is good enough.
			</p>

			<p>
				While I'm (currently) quite happy with the generally low quality
				of our wait function, I still want to do a tiny bit of cleaning
				up. First, let's create a struct for accessing all of the
				available RTT registers:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct Rtt {
	pub mode  : u32,
	pub alarm : u32,
	pub value : u32,
	pub status: u32,
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				As you can see by the number of registers, RTT is much simpler
				than PIO. There's also just one Real-time Timer, so we only need
				to define one constant for its address:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub const RTT: *mut Rtt = 0x400E1A30 as *mut Rtt;
			</pre>

			<p>
				The setup code has changed only a little:
			</p>

			<pre>
(*RTT).mode = 0x00000020;
			</pre>

			<p>
				As has the sleep function:
			</p>

			<pre>
fn sleep_ms(milliseconds: u32) {
	unsafe {
		let sleep_until = (*RTT).value + milliseconds;
		while (*RTT).value &lt; sleep_until {}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!

					The timer value register is 32 bits wide, meaning its
					maximum value is 2<sup>32</sup>. Divided by the frequency of
					the Slow Clock (32,768 Hz), that gives us a result of
					131,072 seconds, around 36.4 hours.
