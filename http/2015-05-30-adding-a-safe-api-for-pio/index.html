			<h1>Adding a Safe API for PIO</h1>

			<p>
				A few weeks ago, we
				<a href="/2015-05-17-cleaning-up-parallel-io">cleaned up
				parallel I/O</a> by adding a module that allows low-level access
				to that feature. This is useful, but we can do better. At the
				very least, we could write write a wrapper around it that
				reduces the need to use <code>unsafe</code> blocks. However, we
				can do even better than that.
			</p>

			<p>
				Rust's type system allows us to write APIs that largely ensure
				at compile time that the API is used correctly. In a lot of
				languages, trying to use a thing before initializing it would,
				at best, result in a runtime exception or, at worst, just
				silently not work. Rust allows us to write APIs in such a way,
				that a program containing such an error wouldn't even compile.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before I get right into it, a few remarks:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This is just a first draft. I'm quite pleased with it
					already, but I'm sure there will be many revisions to it in
					the future.
				</li>
				<li>
					I've decided to only cover features that we're actively
					using in our blink program.. Whenever we will do something
					new with parallel I/O, we will have to extend the API.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				But enough introduction. Let's take a look:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub fn a() -> Controller { Controller(pio::PIO_A) }
pub fn b() -> Controller { Controller(pio::PIO_B) }
pub fn c() -> Controller { Controller(pio::PIO_C) }
pub fn d() -> Controller { Controller(pio::PIO_D) }
pub fn e() -> Controller { Controller(pio::PIO_E) }
pub fn f() -> Controller { Controller(pio::PIO_F) }
			</pre>

			<p>
				For each PIO
				controller<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>, there's a
				function to retrieve it. As you can see, the wrapper module
				accesses the
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/92652977fab574c5423ba8ecd4d965672d185b76/blink/hardware/base/pio.rs">low-level
				PIO module</a> via the <code>pio::</code> prefix.
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct Controller(*mut pio::Controller);

impl Controller {
	pub unsafe fn pin_27(&amp;self) -> Pin&lt;StatusUndefined, OutputStatusUndefined&gt; {
		let &amp;Controller(controller) = self;
		Pin::new(pio::P27, controller)
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				<code>Controller</code> wraps the low-level
				<code>pio::Controller</code>, but doesn't directly provide
				access to its features. Instead, it provides access to the
				controller's pins. There are two things to note here:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Only a single pin can be retrieved. As that's all we need
					for now, I decided to leave it at that. Repeating that
					method 32 times by hand would be too error-prone, and I
					didn't want to introduce a macro at this time (although I'm
					sure I will do so later).
				</li>
				<li>
					The method that retrieves the pin is marked
					<code>unsafe</code>. The <code>Pin</code> type encodes the
					pin's current status to enable compile-time error checking.
					The user can circumvent that protection by creating multiple
					<code>Pin</code> structs for a single pin. The
					<code>unsafe</code> marks this as an error-prone operation
					that needs to be reviewed carefully.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Here's the <code>Pin</code> type:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct Pin&lt;Status, OutputStatus&gt; {
	mask      : u32,
	controller: *mut pio::Controller,

	status       : PhantomData&lt;Status&gt;,
	output_status: PhantomData&lt;OutputStatus&gt;,
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				It contains the pin's mask and a pointer to the controller to be
				able to perform I/O operations. The more interesting element are
				the type parameters though. They encode, statically at
				compile-time, the pin's general status (is it enabled or not)
				and the pin's output status (is it configured for input or
				output).
			</p>

			<p>
				If you take a look at the <code>Controller</code> code above,
				you'll see that both are initially undefined. That's because we
				can't really know whether the pin was used before, or even what
				status a given pin has after system
				reset<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				As Rust disallows unused type parameters, but we don't really
				have a use for those type parameters within the data structure,
				we need to add those two dummy fields of type
				<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/marker/struct.PhantomData.html"><code>PhantomData</code></a>.
			</p>

			<pre>
impl&lt;Status, OutputStatus&gt; Pin&lt;Status, OutputStatus&gt; {
	fn new(mask: u32, controller: *mut pio::Controller)
		-> Pin&lt;Status, OutputStatus&gt;
	{
		Pin {
			mask      : mask,
			controller: controller,

			status       : PhantomData,
			output_status: PhantomData,
		}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This is the first implementation block for <code>Pin</code>,
				which contains the constructor. As you can see from the two type
				parameters after <code>impl</code>, this implementation block is
				fully generic. This means <code>new</code> method can be used to
				create <code>Pin</code>s with any status. This is ok, as the
				constructor is not public and just used internally.
			</p>

			<pre>
impl&lt;OutputStatus&gt; Pin&lt;StatusUndefined, OutputStatus&gt; {
	pub fn enable(self) -> Pin&lt;StatusEnabled, OutputStatus&gt; {
		unsafe { (*self.controller).pio_enable = self.mask };
		Pin::new(self.mask, self.controller)
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This implementation block only applies to pins with an undefined
				status, but doesn't put restrictions on the output status. For
				these pins, the <code>enable</code> method is defined.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two things that are important to understand about this
				construct:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					The <code>enable</code> method encodes what it's doing at
					the type level. For example, if you call <code>enable</code>
					on a
					<code>Pin&lt;StatusUndefined, OutputStatusUndefined&gt;</code>,
					you will get back a
					<code>Pin&lt;StatusEnabled, OutputStatusUndefined&gt;</code>.
					You can't call it on pins that are already enabled.
				</li>
				<li>
					As <code>enable</code> takes the <code>self</code> argument
					by value, the old pin is being consumed by it, due to Rust's
					move semantics. That means you can't keep a copy of your old
					<code>Pin</code> and use it to trick the API into doing
					stuff that's not supposed to be possible.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				I'm not actually sure whether this block is entirely correct
				though. It assumes that the output status is always preserved,
				that you can just take a pin whose status you know nothing
				about, enable it and assume that the output status is the same
				as it was before. I don't know if that's a safe assumption. I'll
				have to test this at some point.
			</p>

			<pre>
impl Pin&lt;StatusEnabled, OutputStatusUndefined&gt; {
	pub fn enable_output(self) -> Pin&lt;StatusEnabled, OutputStatusEnabled&gt; {
		unsafe { (*self.controller).output_enable = self.mask };
		Pin::new(self.mask, self.controller)
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				The next implementation block allows you to enable pin output.
				Note that it's only defined for enabled pins with an undefined
				output status. This API makes it impossible to configure output
				on a pin that you forgot to enable. A program attempting to do
				this just won't compile.
			</p>

			<pre>
impl Pin&lt;StatusEnabled, OutputStatusEnabled&gt; {
	pub fn set_output(&amp;self) {
		unsafe { (*self.controller).set_output_data = self.mask };
	}

	pub fn clear_output(&amp;self) {
		unsafe { (*self.controller).clear_output_data = self.mask };
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				If you've enabled your <code>Pin</code> and enabled its output,
				you can control the output signal using those two methods.
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct StatusUndefined;
pub struct StatusEnabled;

pub struct OutputStatusUndefined;
pub struct OutputStatusEnabled;
			</pre>

			<p>
				And finally, these are the different state types for
				<code>Pin</code>. Those are just empty structs, which means they
				are just used as marker types and don't have any footprint at
				runtime.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's the API! As I said, it's incomplete and only provides the
				bare minimum that is required to support our program. We can
				extend it as needed in the future.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's take a look at how it's used. You might remember, the
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/blob/2cc0197b14561a4c4a3ee61409125221e5875f0c/blink/main.rs">old
				version of the program using the low-level PIO module</a> had a
				big unsafe block and dereferenced all those unsafe pointers. The
				new API makes things a lot nicer.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first thing we need to do is getting the <code>Pin</code>
				instance.
			</p>

			<pre>
let led = unsafe { pio::b().pin_27() };
			</pre>

			<p>
				As I explained above, this operation is unsafe, as it allows us
				to retrieve multiple instances for the same pin and circumvent
				the guarantees of the API that way. It's the only unsafe block
				that is required to use the new API.
			</p>

			<pre>
let led = led
	.enable()
	.enable_output();
			</pre>

			<p>
				This is the pin initialization code that enables the pin and
				configures it for output. As <code>enable</code> and
				<code>enable_output</code> consume the pin, we need to capture
				the result in a new
				variable<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>. Otherwise,
				there would be no way for us to access the enabled pin ever
				again.
			</p>

			<pre>
loop {
	led.set_output();
	sleep_ms(200);
	led.clear_output();
	sleep_ms(800);
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				And finally, we can set and clear the output, to make the LED
				blink.
			</p>

			<p>
				For any of you who don't believe me that this API basically
				prevents you from misusing it, here's an example. This is what
				happens if we leave out the middle part of the program and try
				to use the LED without initializing it:
			</p>

			<pre class="wrap">
blink/main.rs:21:7: 21:19 error: no method named `set_output` found for type `hardware::api::pio::Pin&lt;hardware::api::pio::StatusUndefined, hardware::api::pio::OutputStatusUndefined&gt;` in the current scope
blink/main.rs:21 		led.set_output();
                 		    ^~~~~~~~~~~~
blink/main.rs:23:7: 23:21 error: no method named `clear_output` found for type `hardware::api::pio::Pin&lt;hardware::api::pio::StatusUndefined, hardware::api::pio::OutputStatusUndefined&gt;` in the current scope
blink/main.rs:23 		led.clear_output();
                 		    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
error: aborting due to 2 previous errors
			</pre>

			<p>
				The methods simply aren't available. Without cheating (i.e.
				using <code>unsafe</code>), there's just no way to call them
				unless you properly initialize the pin.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!

					Yes, the new variable is called the same as the old one.
					It's still a new variable, and it has a different type.
					Initially <code>led</code> has the type
					<code>Pin&lt;StatusUndefined, OutputStatusUndefined&gt;</code>.
					After this operation, the type is
					<code>Pin&lt;StatusEnabled, OutputStatusEnabled&gt;</code>.
