			<h1>Adding a Safe API for the Timer</h1>

			<p>
				In the last article, we added
				<a href="/2015-06-01-adding-a-safe-api-for-pio">a safe API for
				the parallel I/O code</a>. This time, we're going to do the same
				for the real-time timer.
			</p>

			<p>
				You might remember that the timer code has already been cleaned
				up a while ago, by adding
				<a href="/2015-05-18-cleaning-up-the-timer-code">a low-level
				module that describes the hardware interface</a>. We are going
				to build on that with a safe timer API.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's start with initialization:
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct Timer;

impl Timer {
	pub fn new() -> Timer {
		// Set the timer to a resolution of a millisecond
		unsafe { (*RTT).mode = 0x00000020; }
		Timer
	}

	// The rest of the API belongs here. See below.
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Pretty simple, and not different from what we did
				before<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>. Only here, the
				unsafe block is stored away within a safe API.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's continue with the code that reads the timer value:
			</p>

			<pre>
impl Timer {
	// Initialization code belongs here. See above.

	pub fn value(&amp;self) -> u32 {
		unsafe { (*RTT).value }
	}

	// The rest of the API belongs here. See below.
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This is a pretty simple method that just returns the current
				value of the timer.
			</p>

			<p>
				And the last missing piece, our sleep function:
			</p>

			<pre>
impl Timer {
	// The code we already saw belongs here. See above.

	pub fn sleep_ms(&amp;self, milliseconds: u32) {
		let sleep_until = Wrapping(self.value()) + Wrapping(milliseconds);
		while self.value() &lt; sleep_until.0 {}
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				It looks similar to what we had before, with one big difference:
				Instead of regular addition, we're using wrapping addition.
			</p>

			<p>
				Why is this important? Well, Rust as a language is
				very concerned with preventing accidental mistakes. This
				includes integer overflow. Unfortunately, checking each integer
				addition for overflow would be far too expensive in terms of
				performance, which is not acceptable for a systems programming
				language like Rust. These constraints have lead to the following
				compromise: Integer addition is checked in debug mode, and
				overflow will cause a panic. In release mode, those checks are
				optimized out<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, how does that information help us? Well, it turns out it
				doesn't. The sleep method contains a rather glaringly obvious
				bug (which wasn't so glaringly obvious to me a few months ago,
				when I wrote it): When the addition overflows,
				<code>self.value()</code> will always be larger than
				<code>sleep_until</code>, meaning the method would return
				immediately instead of sleeping.
			</p>

			<p>
				At this point, this is not that critical, however. The timer
				value won't wrap that
				often<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a> and the method
				has other large
				problems<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>. We will have
				to replace it with something more advanced anyway, and in the
				meantime it's good enough to keep our LED blinking.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before we wrap up, let's take a look at our current program:
			</p>

			<pre>
use hardware::safe::pio;
use hardware::safe::rtt::Timer;


pub fn start() {
	// Pin 27 of the PIOB parallel I/O controller corresponds to pin 13 on the
	// Arduino Due, which is the built-in LED (labelled "L").
	let led = unsafe { pio::b().pin_27() };
	let led = led
		.enable()
		.enable_output();

	let timer = Timer::new();

	loop {
		led.set_output();
		timer.sleep_ms(200);
		led.clear_output();
		timer.sleep_ms(800);
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				I think it has cleaned up nicely! Except for a single unsafe
				block which should be very easy to keep straight, it's pretty
				much idiot-proof. Quite the important attribute, considering
				that I'm the one who's working on it.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!

					According to

					calculations</a>, the timer will wrap roughly every 36
					hours. A very relevant timeframe for an embedded system, but
					we can still overlook at our current state.

					The problems are high CPU and power usage, and accuracy.
