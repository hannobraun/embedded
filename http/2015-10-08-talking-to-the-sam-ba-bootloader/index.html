			<h1>Talking to the SAM-BA Bootloader</h1>

			<p>
				So far, we've been using
				<a href="http://shumatech.com/web/products/bossa">BOSSA</a> to
				upload our program to the microcontroller. This has been working
				okay, but recently, when picking up this little project again
				after a few months of absence, a problem appeared: The program
				upload stopped working completely. The <code>bossac</code>
				command would just hang forever. This was a huge problem of
				course, as it blocked all further development efforts.
			</p>

			<p>
				After performing the typical "programmer in trouble" rain dance
				for a while (which is usually an alternation between trying
				everything I can think of and increasingly desperate Google
				searches that only turn up useless forum posts), I bit the
				bullet and downloaded Atmel's
				<a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSAM-BAIN-SYSTEMPROGRAMMER.aspx">official
				upload tool</a>, SAM-BA. I had wanted to avoid this, as this is
				the kind of software that requires you leave your name and
				address before you can even  download it. But I was desperate,
				so I involuntarily signed up to Atmel's mailing list and gave
				the tool a try.
			</p>

			<p>
				It took me a moment to figure out how to use
				it<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>, but I succeeded in
				using it to upload my program. That gave me a working solution
				and told me that at least the microcontroller wasn't broken.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wasn't very happy about that though. First, I'd rather use an
				open source tool that I can understand and modify, if need be.
				Second, I'd like to make my development process as smooth as
				possible, and fooling around with some GUI application every
				time I need to test a program on a microcontroller just doesn't
				cut it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Both BOSSA and SAM-BA use the <code>/dev/ttyACM*</code> devices
				to communicate with the microcontroller. I don't fully
				understand this topic, but basically, the Linux kernel makes
				even modern hardware look like a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teleprinter</a>
				from days of yore. User space programs can access such a device
				via a file in the <code>/dev</code> directory. Microcontrollers
				seem to end up as a <code>/dev/ttyACM*</code> file, for example
				<code>/dev/ttyACM0</code><a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, if a device is presented to me as a file, I should be able
				to use standard tools like <code>cat</code> and
				<code>echo</code> to talk to the device, shouldn't I? Well,
				let's try it. Follow these steps:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB, using the
					native USB port on the board. That's the one closer to the
					reset button.
				</li>
				<li>
					Press the erase button for a few seconds<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					There should be at least one <code>ttyACM*</code> device in
					<code>/dev</code>. If there are multiple, pick one that
					looks right and re-try the following steps until you figured
					out the one that connects to the microcontroller. I'll use
					<code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> as an example in the following
					steps.
				</li>
				<li>
					Start a background process that will print anything the
					device sends: <code>cat /dev/ttyACM0 &amp;</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					Tell the bootloader to print its
					version<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>:
					<code>echo V# > /dev/ttyACM0</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					You should see something like the following:
					<code>v1.1 Dec 15 2010 19:25:04</code>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Now we know how to talk to the microcontroller directly, without
				using some complicated program that we don't understand as a
				mediator. I don't know yet where this will lead, but it
				certainly is exciting.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's it for today. As always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				See you next time!

					For anyone reading this who has trouble using SAM-BA, here's
					what worked for me. The following instructions pertain to
					the Arduino Due board (which has an Atmel SAM3X8E
					microcontroller on it) and the Linux version of SAM-BA 2.15:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Connect the Arduino Due to your computer via USB. Make
						sure to use the native USB port on the Due, not the
						programmer port. The programmer port is closer to the
						power jack, the native port is closer to the reset
						button.
					</li>
					<li>
						Erase the flash memory by pressing the erase button for
						a few seconds. This will also set up the bootloader
						correctly, so the SAM-BA program can talk to it and use
						it to upload the program.
					</li>
					<li>
						Start SAM-BA and choose the correct connection and
						board. I can't really help you with finding out which
						connection is the right one. Just try one and repeat
						until it works. The correct board selection for the
						Arduino Due is <code>at91sam3x8-ek</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Press the <code>Connect</code> button to connect to the
						board. A bigger window should appear. If you get an
						error message, something is wrong. Maybe try to select
						another connection.
					</li>
					<li>
						Below the memory display, select the <code>Flash</code>
						tab (might already be open) and enter the path of your
						program file (<code>.bin</code>) into the <code>Send
						File Name</code> field. You can use the button to the
						right of the field to select a file.
					</li>
					<li>
						Press the <code>Send File</code> button to the right.
						SAM-BA might ask you about locking the regions. I don't
						think this choice doesn't matter very much. I opted for
						<code>No</code>. Please check the console at the bottom
						for error messages. None should have shown up.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can now press <code>Compare sent file with
						memory</code>. It should tell you, that the memory
						contents match the sent file exactly.
					</li>
					<li>
						We've now uploaded the program, but we need to make sure
						that the microcontroller actually boots it. Under
						<code>Scripts</code> select <code>Boot from Flash
						(GPNVM1)</code> and press <code>Execute</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						That should have done it! Press the reset button on the
						Due, and your program should start running. In our case
						that means the LED should start blinking.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					I plan to write about the topic of uploading programs in
					more detail in future articles, so stay tuned.
				</p>

				<a name="note-2"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[2]</span>
				<p>
					The reason it's <code>ttyACM</code> and not something else
					is explained in
					<a href="https://www.rfc1149.net/blog/2013/03/05/what-is-the-difference-between-devttyusbx-and-devttyacmx/">this article</a>.
				</p>

				<a name="note-3"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[3]</span>
				<p>
					This step is very important. It doesn't just erase the flash
					memory, it also makes sure that the microcontroller boots
					into the bootloader. The bootloader controls the USB port,
					which is what makes the following steps work. If the blink
					program is still running, nothing on the board will control
					the USB port. This makes the port a useless piece of metal.
					Your computer won't even recognize that something has been
					connected.
				</p>

				<a name="note-4"></a>
				<span class="footnote-number">[4]</span>
				<p>
					The commands that the bootloader responds to are documented
					in the
					<a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-11057-32-bit-Cortex-M3-Microcontroller-SAM3X-SAM3A_Datasheet.pdf">data
					sheet</a>, chapter 20.4.
