			<h1>Telling the Microcontroller to Boot from Flash</h1>

			<p>
				In the
				<a href="/2015-10-08-talking-to-the-sam-ba-bootloader">previous
				article</a>, we started experimenting with talking to the SAM-BA
				bootloader directly. There already was a first success in
				getting the bootloader to print its version, without the use of
				any intermediary program.
			</p>

			<p>
				After that, I thought, how hard can it be to write a Rust
				program that uploads our program? I mean, we have documentation
				on how to talk to the
				bootloader<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a> and the
				<a href="https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA">source code for
				BOSSA</a>. Shouldn't that be enough? Well, as it turns out some
				experimentation (and some plain old
				banging-my-head-against-the-wall) was still required, but first
				results are looking good.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before I get into that though, let's address the "why" first.
				Why would I write that program instead of using something
				existing, like the
				<a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSAM-BAIN-SYSTEMPROGRAMMER.aspx">official
				SAM-BA In-system Programmer</a> by Atmel?
				Well, for one, as I explained
				<a href="/2015-10-08-talking-to-the-sam-ba-bootloader">last
				time</a>, the previous solution, BOSSA, stopped working for me
				for unknown reasons and Atmel's SAM-BA doesn't really fit into
				my workflow.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, I don't suppose I could write a general replacement for
				either of these in the amount of time I'm willing to spend on
				that project, but it should certainly be possible to write a
				partial replacement that does exactly what I need it to, and do
				it better. And also, let's not forget the main goal of this
				whole endeavor so far: To learn more about embedded programming,
				and this allows us to see the microcontroller from a different
				direction than usual.
			</p>

			<p>
				But enough with the introduction, let's get into the
				program<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>!
			</p>

			<pre>
fn main() {
	// Parsing of command-line arguments not shown here.

	let     port   = init_port(&amp;device_path).unwrap();
	let mut sam_ba = SamBa::new(port);
	let     eefc_0 = Eefc::eefc_0();

	// Here comes some more initialization and the command execution code. See
	// below.
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Here's the rough outline of the initialization code. First, we
				initialize a serial port by calling <code>init_port</code>. The
				<code>device_path</code> is passed in by the user as a
				command-line argument<a class="footnote" href="#note-3">[3]</a>.
				Then we create a <code>SamBa</code> instance, which is our
				interface to the SAM-BA bootloader. We also create an instance
				of <code>Eefc</code>, which we'll use to talk to the Enhanced
				Embedded Flash Controller (EEFC) that's part of the
				microcontroller<a class="footnote" href="#note-4">[4]</a>,
				specifically to the one responsible for the first flash memory
				bank, of which the SAM3X8E has
				two<a class="footnote" href="#note-5">[5]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'll get into some more details later, but let's continue with
				the rough outline first.
			</p>

			<pre>
fn main() {
	// Argument parsing and the previously shown initialization code belong
	// here.

	sam_ba.set_normal_mode().unwrap();

	// Command execution fits here. See below.
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This, unsurprisingly, sets SAM-BA to normal mode, which means
				it will send answers in binary. The alternative would be
				terminal mode, which sends answers as text. Normal mode looked
				like it was easier to work with, so I went with it.
			</p>

			<pre>
fn main() {
	// Initialization code not shown here. See above.

	match command.as_ref() {
		"version" =>
			print!("{}", sam_ba.display_version().unwrap()),
		"boot-mode" => {
			let result =
				eefc_0.execute_command::&lt;GetGpnvmBit, _&gt;(
					&amp;mut sam_ba,
					GpnvmNumber::BootModeSelection,
				)
				.unwrap();

			print!("{:0>8x}\n", result)
		},
		"boot-from-flash" => {
			eefc_0.execute_command::&lt;SetGpnvmBit, _&gt;(
				&amp;mut sam_ba,
				GpnvmNumber::BootModeSelection,
			)
			.unwrap();
		},
		_ =>
			print!("Unknown command: {}\n", command),
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Here we're executing a <code>command</code> that has been passed
				by the user via the command-line. <code>version</code> tells
				SAM-BA to return its version. <code>boot-mode</code> will print
				the value that controls what memory the microcontroller boots
				from, and "boot-from-flash" will tell it to boot from flash
				memory next time it's powered up.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's basically all it does. Easy, isn't it? From here on out,
				I'll present all the important in detail, but I won't show off
				every single line of code. Please
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/tree/f02b1485b8df6adc4adc8f86a4082544823d788e/uploader">check out the full code on GitHub</a>, if you're interested in
				all the details.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's start with the initialization of the serial port.
			</p>

			<pre>
fn init_port(path: &amp;str) -> serial::Result&lt;serial::SystemPort&gt; {
	let mut port = serial::open(path).unwrap();

	try!(port.reconfigure(&amp;|settings| {
		try!(settings.set_baud_rate(serial::Baud115200));
		settings.set_char_size(serial::Bits8);
		settings.set_parity(serial::ParityNone);
		settings.set_stop_bits(serial::Stop1);

		Ok(())
	}));

	Ok(port)
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				This uses the excellent
				<a href="https://crates.io/crates/serial">serial</a> library to
				initialize the port in the correct
				manner<a class="footnote" href="#note-6">[6]</a>. If you have
				some basic knowledge about serial ports, this should be
				self-explanatory. Explaining all about
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial
				ports</a> is unfortunately out of the scope of this article.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next up, our interface to the SAM-BA bootloader.
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct SamBa {
	port: serial::SystemPort,
}

impl SamBa {
	// Some less interesting code has been omitted.

	pub fn read_word(&amp;mut self, address: u32) -&gt; Result&lt;u32&gt; {
		try!(write!(self.port, "w{:0>8X},#", address));
		let result = try!(self.port.read_u32::&lt;LittleEndian&gt;());

		Ok(result)
	}

	pub fn write_word(&amp;mut self, address: u32, value: u32) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
		try!(write!(self.port, "W{:0>8X},{:0>8X}#", address, value));
		Ok(())
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				The most important function of SAM-BA is letting us to read from
				and write to memory. It has several commands to do this, but for
				now we just need to read and write whole words (which are 32
				bits wide). Writing is pretty straight-forward, using the
				<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/io/">I/O</a> and
				<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/fmt/">formatting</a>
				facilities from Rust's standard library. To read the answer,
				we're using the (also quite excellent)
				<a href="https://crates.io/crates/byteorder">byteorder</a>
				crate.
			</p>

			<p>
				Being able to directly access the memory on the microcontroller
				has obvious applications (we're trying to upload a program,
				after all), but think about it for a moment: As we've learned
				previously, the ARM architecture uses memory-mapped I/O, meaning
				that doing just about anything with the hardware takes the form
				of reading from and writing to memory addresses. SAM-BA lets us
				do this from a connected PC, which theoretically means we can
				remotely control the microcontroller from a connected PC.
			</p>

			<p>
				We'll do just that in a moment, to tell it to boot from flash
				memory, but there might be interesting applications beyond that.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's continue with the interface to the EEFC.
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct Eefc {
	command_register: u32,
	status_register : u32,
	result_register : u32,
}

impl Eefc {
	pub fn eefc_0() -> Eefc {
		let base = 0x400e0a00;

		Eefc {
			command_register: base + 0x04,
			status_register : base + 0x08,
			result_register : base + 0x0c,
		}
	}

	// Some more code belongs here. We'll take a look at it below.
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Here we set up the addresses for the EEFC controller. EEFC has
				three registers that are relevant to us. We'll write commands to
				the command register (called <code>EEFC_FCR</code>), read their
				results from the result register (<code>EEFC_FRR</code>), and
				read the general status from the status register
				(<code>EEFC_FSR</code>).<a class="footnote" href="#note-7">[7]</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				This is similar to
				<a href="/2015-05-17-cleaning-up-parallel-io">the approach we've
				been using previously to talk to hardware</a> from our program
				running directly on the microcontroller. The difference is,
				running directly on the device, we can use a pointer to a struct
				to access the various. Here, we'll need to go through SAM-BA as
				an intermediary, so we'll need to handle the addresses of the
				registers directly.
			</p>

			<pre>
impl Eefc {
	// The code shown above belongs here.

	pub fn execute_command&lt;C, A&gt;(&amp;self, sam_ba: &amp;mut SamBa, argument: A)
		-> Result&lt;u32&gt;
		where
			C: Command&lt;Argument=A&gt;,
			A: Argument,
	{
		let command =
			0x5a &lt;&lt; 24
			| (argument.value() as u32) &lt;&lt; 8
			| C::value() as u32;

		try!(sam_ba.write_word(self.command_register, command));

		while try!(sam_ba.read_word(self.status_register)) &amp; 1 == 0 {}
		assert_eq!(try!(sam_ba.read_word(self.status_register)), 1);

		sam_ba.read_word(self.result_register)
	}
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				As the name suggests, this is the method that executes the
				commands the EEFC understands. Each command is executed in the
				same way (as implemented here), but there are different commands
				that take different kinds of arguments. This method uses some
				type system magic to make itself
				idiot-proof<a class="footnote" href="#note-8">[8]</a>, meaning
				the user is prevented at compile time from passing an invalid
				combination of command and
				argument<a class="footnote" href="#note-9">[9]</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Other than that, it's pretty straight-forward:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The command is built from a magic value (<code>0x5a</code>)
					that's the same for all commands, the 16-bit argument and
					the 8-bit identifier of the command
					itself<a class="footnote" href="#note-10">[10]</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is then written to the command register and we do a bit
					of busy waiting until the status register is no longer 0
					(meaning the device is no longer busy and the command has
					finished
					executing)<a class="footnote" href="#note-11">[11]</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					After that, we assert that the status register shows
					everything is okay (it might not be, for example if we've
					sent an invalid command).
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally, we read the result from the result register and
					return it<a class="footnote" href="#note-12">[12]</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				I promise, we're almost done. One of the last things we need to
				know about are the <code>Command</code> and
				<code>Argument</code> traits.
			</p>

			<pre>
trait Command {
	type Argument: Argument;

	fn value() -> u8;
}

trait Argument {
	fn value(self) -> u16;
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				Not much to see here. A command has an associated argument type
				and a value that identifies it. An argument can be encoded as a
				16-bit value.
			</p>

			<p>
				And the last bit before we actually get to use the program: The
				implementation of the actual commands.
			</p>

			<pre>
pub struct SetGpnvmBit;

impl Command for SetGpnvmBit {
	type Argument = GpnvmNumber;

	fn value() -> u8 { 0x0b }
}


pub struct GetGpnvmBit;

impl Command for GetGpnvmBit {
	type Argument = GpnvmNumber;

	fn value() -> u8 { 0x0d }
}


pub enum GpnvmNumber {
	// Security          = 0,
	BootModeSelection = 1,
	// FlashSelection    = 2,
}

impl Argument for GpnvmNumber {
	fn value(self) -> u16 { self as u16 }
}
			</pre>

			<p>
				For now we just need two commands: One for setting a GPNVM bit
				and one for reading its value. There are three GPNVM bits, but
				we need only one right now: The one that controls what memory
				the microcontroller boots from. That can be either ROM (where
				the bootloader lives) or Flash (where our program
				lives).<a class="footnote" href="#note-13">[13]</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				As a reminder, here's how we use this infrastructure to set the
				boot mode selection bit, i.e. tell the microcontroller to boot
				from flash on the next reset:
			</p>

			<pre>
eefc_0.execute_command::&lt;SetGpnvmBit, _&gt;(
	&amp;mut sam_ba,
	GpnvmNumber::BootModeSelection,
)
			</pre>

			<p>
				So, on the home stretch. Let's use the program make the
				microcontroller boot from flash! If we connect the board to a
				PC via USB on the native port (that's the one closer to the
				<code>RESET</code> button) and erase the flash memory by
				pressing the <code>ERASE</code> button for a moment, that should
				not only clear the flash memory, but also start the bootloader.
				We can confirm this (on Linux) by running <code>lsusb</code>.
				There should be an entry for the board that looks somewhat like
				this:
			</p>

			<pre>
Bus 003 Device 004: ID 03eb:6124 Atmel Corp. at91sam SAMBA bootloader
			</pre>

			<p>
				Now we can switch to the
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded/tree/f02b1485b8df6adc4adc8f86a4082544823d788e/uploader">uploader
				directory</a> and build and run it like this, to get the current
				value of the boot mode selection
				bit<a class="footnote" href="#note-14">[14]</a>:
			</p>

			<pre>
$ cargo run -- /dev/ttyACM0 boot-mode
			</pre>

			<p>
				The device path might be different on your machine (like
				/dev/ttyACM0, /dev/ttyACM1 or similar). If you have multiple
				device files, just try all of them until one works without
				error.
			</p>

			<p>
				If everything worked, the output should look like this:
				<code>00000000</code>
			</p>

			<p>
				This means the boot mode selection bit is 0, and the device
				boots from ROM. Only makes sense, because if it didn't, how
				would we talk to the bootloader?
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, let's tell it to boot from flash memory:
			</p>

			<pre>
$ cargo run -- /dev/ttyACM0 boot-from-flash
			</pre>

			<p>
				Now, we can ask for the boot selection bit again:
			</p>

			<pre>
$ cargo run -- /dev/ttyACM0 boot-mode
			</pre>

			<p>
				The result should look like this: <code>00000002</code>. This
				shows all the GPNVM bits, and the boot mode selection bit is the
				second least significant one, which means the value 2 makes
				total sense.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now for the final step: Press the <code>RESET</code> button for
				a moment and run <code>lsusb</code> again. The entry we
				previously saw should no longer be there. Why? Well, we told the
				microcontroller to boot from flash memory, but didn't upload a
				program. This means no program is currently running on the
				device, so there is nothing that controls the USB port.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can start over by pressing <code>ERASE</code>, to get back
				to the bootloader.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Phew, that was quite a bit of ground that we covered today! As
				always, the full code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>.
				Tune in next time, when we will hopefully build on today's
				foundation and actually upload a program.

				<p>
					This kind of stuff should be second nature to any advanced
					Rust user, but to the beginners out there that stuff
					probably looks like magic. Unfortunately I wasn't able to
					find a good explanation for this technique on short notice,
					so here's the rundown:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The method accepts two type arguments, <code>C</code>
						for command and <code>A</code> for the argument. That's
						called
						<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/generics.html">Generics</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						There's an actual (non-type) argument of type
						<code>A</code>, to pass the argument. There's no
						argument of type <code>C</code> for the command, because
						we don't need it. The compiler needs to know which
						command we're calling the method for, but there's no
						value associated with this command at run-time.
					</li>
					<li>
						But you can't just pass use any type for <code>C</code>
						and <code>A</code>. They have
						<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/traits.html">trait
						bounds</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>A</code> is straight-forward. Whatever type you
						pass for <code>A</code> just needs to implement the
						<code>Argument</code> trait.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>C</code> needs to implement the trait
						<code>Command</code>. But not only that.
						<code>Command</code> has an associated type for the
						kind of argument it takes.
					</li>
					<li>
						That <code>Argument=A</code> bit makes sure that you
						can't just pass any argument with any command. Once
						you've decided on a command, you can only pass the
						argument type that the command type says it accepts.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>

					topic, but hopefully it will point you in the right
					direction. Feel free to
