            <h1>Small Fixes</h1>

            <p>
                It's been a while since we looked at our blink program. Since then, I've made a number of small fixes and improvements that I'd like to present today.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most prominent source of changes were upgrades to later Rust versions<a class="footnote" href="#note-1">[1]</a>. While upgrading to a newer version of the Rust language generally doesn't require changes to your program, we've been using a number of unstable features, which are not guaranteed to stay the same.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's take a look of two of those features again: <code>no_std</code> and <code>core</code>. To reiterate, <code>no_std</code> indicates that we're not using Rust's standard library. The standard library is designed to run in typical operating system environments, and is not suitable for a microprocessor like the one we're working with.. <code>core</code> indicates that we're using Rust's core library instead. The core library is a subset of the standard library that provides many useful things and can run just about anywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both <code>no_std</code> and <code>core</code> have been stabilized, so we don't need to specify them anymore. Here's the updated feature specification:
            </p>

            <pre>
#![feature(intrinsics, lang_items)]
            </pre>

            <p>
                Hopefully in time, those remaining two will also be stabilized. At that point we'll no longer be required to develop using a nightly version and can rely on stable Rust.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to being stabilized, <code>no_std</code> has changed a bit. By not using the standard library, we now opt into using the core library automatically. This makes our code a bit simpler. Here's what we had to do previously:
            </p>

            <pre>
#![no_std]


#[macro_use]
extern crate core;

use core::prelude::*;
            </pre>

            <p>
                An this is what the same code looks like now:
            </p>

            <pre>
#![no_std]
            </pre>

            <p>
                Doesn't make much of a difference for us, but it certainly makes things easier for anyone who has to figure this out for the first time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The rest of the changes concern the build process and were all mad to <code>target.json</code>. I'm going to describe each of those changes separately, and then link to the final version of <code>target.json</code> after those descriptions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first modification to <code>target.json</code> was made because of a linker error that I got when trying to set up the build process on another computer. I'm not 100% sure what caused that error, but I think it's because I had a newer version of <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code> there. Here's the error message:
            </p>

            <pre>
error: linking with `arm-none-eabi-gcc` failed: exit code: 1
note: "arm-none-eabi-gcc" "-L" "/home/hanno/.multirust/toolchains/nightly/lib/rustlib/target.json/lib" "output/blink.0.o" "-o" "output/blink.elf" "-Wl,--gc-sections" "-nodefaultlibs" "-L" "output" "-L" "/home/hanno/.multirust/toolchains/nightly/lib/rustlib/target.json/lib" "-Wl,-Bstatic" "-Wl,-Bdynamic" "/home/hanno/Projects/embedded/output/libcore.rlib" "-Tlinker-script.ld"
note: /usr/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/5.3.0/../../../../arm-none-eabi/bin/ld: cannot find crt0.o: No such file or directory
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

error: aborting due to previous error
            </pre>

            <p>
                The important bit of that error message is the following:
                <code>cannot find crt0.o: No such file or directory</code>. Not sure what that file is, but it seems we don't need it. Passing <code>-nostartfiles</code> to the linker solves the problem, and we can easily do that by adding the following line to <code>target.json</code>:
            </p>

            <pre>
"pre-link-args": [ "-nostartfiles" ],
            </pre>

            <p>
                The next change is a simplification that I found out about while snooping around the <a href="http://zinc.rs/">zinc.rs</a> repository<a class="footnote" href="#note-2">[2]</a>. Back when we <a href="/2015-05-08-translating-the-program-to-rust">translated the program into Rust</a>, we had to add an empty library called <code>libcompiler-rt.a</code> that the Rust compiler linked to, even though none of its contents were used by our program.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can simply tell Rust that we don't need it by adding the following line to <code>target.json</code>:
            </p>

            <pre>
"no-compiler-rt": true,
            </pre>

            <p>
                The last change was required when a Rust upgrade suddenly caused the following error:
            </p>

            <pre>
rustc: /buildslave/rust-buildbot/slave/nightly-dist-rustc-linux/build/src/llvm/lib/CodeGen/MachineFunction.cpp:108: llvm::MachineFunction::MachineFunction(const llvm::Function*, const llvm::TargetMachine&amp;, unsigned int, llvm::MachineModuleInfo&amp;): Assertion `TM.isCompatibleDataLayout(getDataLayout()) &amp;&amp; "Can't create a MachineFunction using a Module with a " "Target-incompatible DataLayout attached\n"' failed.
            </pre>

            <p>
                That error is documented in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31367">Rust issue #31367</a>. As per that issue, the solution is simple: Remove the <code>data-layout</code> specification from <code>target.json</code>. No one seems to know what that error is really about, and it's unclear whether that is really a reliable solution, so I hope this won't cause any hard-to-debug bugs in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                That was all. The updated version of <code>target.json</code> looks like this:
            </p>

            <pre>
{
    "llvm-target"         : "thumbv7m-unknown-none-eabi",
    "linker"              : "arm-none-eabi-gcc",
    "pre-link-args"       : [ "-nostartfiles" ],
    "no-compiler-rt"      : true,
    "target-endian"       : "little",
    "target-pointer-width": "32",
    "arch"                : "arm",
    "os"                  : "none",
    "executables"         : true
}
            </pre>

            <p>
                That wraps use up for today. As always, the full code is available <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded">on GitHub</a>. See you next time!

                <p>
                    At the time of writing, I'm using one of the most recent Rust versions: <code>rustc 1.9.0-nightly (339a409bf 2016-03-01)</code>

                    I also got an email from a very helpful reader who recommended the same solution. Unfortunately I can't find that email right now and haven't asked whether I'm allowed to mention them by name anyway, but I'd like to use this footnote to give my thanks anyway!
