# ATTENTION:
# Before calling this script, the Arduino needs to be erased. Until we figure
# out how to do that automatically, doing it manually is a feasible workaround.
# Just make sure to press the tiny "Erase" button on the Arduino Due before
# uploading and everything should work.

# ATTENTION 2:
# This build script requires an installation of the Arduino IDE. Please make
# sure you have a recent version installed and add its path to the ARDUINO_IDE
# variable below.

# The following variables need to be modified for your system before the build
# can work.

# Installation directory of the Arduino IDE
ARDUINO_IDE=/home/hanno/Downloads/arduino-1.7.0-linux64

# From here on out, the script *should* work without system-specific
# modifications.
